a I-OP

Lot O

in O
the O

The O
hotel O
restraunt B-AS
food I-AS
is O
quite B-OP
average I-OP
and O
extremely B-OP
overpriced I-OP
plenty O
of O
other O
restraunts O
and O
takeaway O
places B-AS
within B-OP
walking I-OP
distance I-OP
though O
so O
not O
a O
huge O
issue O

The O
hotel B-AS
was O
central B-OP
with O
nice B-OP
breakfast B-AS
and O
24 O
hour O
consierge O

Bed B-AS
comfortable B-OP
although O
the O
superior O
room O
had O
twin O
beds O
together O
that O
didnt O
stay O
together O
causing O
a O
gap O

The O
location B-AS
feels O
a O
little O
too O
far B-OP
from I-OP
the I-OP
town I-OP
centre I-OP
but O
everything B-AS
else O
is O
amazing I-OP

The O
bed B-AS
was O
super B-OP
comfy I-OP
and O
the O
thermostat B-AS
meant O
you O
could O
easily B-OP
warm I-OP
up I-OP
cool B-OP
down I-OP
the O
room O

I O
wondered O
why O
he O

Location B-AS
was O
fantastic B-OP

Staff B-AS
was O
very B-OP
attentive I-OP

hussle I-OP
and I-OP
bussle I-OP
of O
city O
life O
for O
a O
good B-OP
night B-AS
s I-AS
sleep I-AS

So O
very B-OP
good I-OP
to O
sleep B-AS
there O
in O
the O
first O
or O
last O
night O
of O
your O
vacation O

Far B-OP
from I-OP
restaurants B-AS
and O
shopping B-AS
expensive B-OP
by O

Extremely B-OP
nice I-OP
staff B-AS
with O
very B-OP
good I-OP

English B-AS
skills I-AS

Its O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
no O
ware O

They O
charge B-OP
for O
parking B-AS
on O
their O
premises O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
its O
far O
to O
any O
civilisation O

I O
m O
disgusted O
that O
the O
hotel O
has O
such O
comfy B-OP
beds B-AS
and O

I O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
full O
nights O
sleep O

Crazy O

The O
breakfast B-AS
was O
very B-OP
good I-OP

Everything O
This O
place B-AS
was O
mind B-OP
blowing I-OP

Such O
a O
beautiful B-OP
hotel B-AS
with O
amazing B-OP
rooms B-AS

The O
quality B-AS
of I-AS
food I-AS
was O
fantastic B-OP
in O
particular O
the O
breakfast O

t O
it O
nice O
if O
we O
were O
treated O
in O
a O
better O
attitude O
and O
if O
the O
upgrade B-AS
was O
not B-OP
existed I-OP

so O
we O
decided O
to O
take O
the O
bus O
instead O
and O
the O
hotel O
was O
only O
about O
a O
5 B-OP
minute I-OP
bus B-AS
ride I-AS
away O
from O
city O
center O

The O
bed B-AS
was O
very B-OP
comfortable I-OP

We O
started O
to O
notice O
the O
poor O
workmanship O
throughout O
the O
building B-OP
tiling O
painting O
wallpaper O
etc O
just O
not B-OP
finished I-OP
off I-OP
like O
they O
were O
in O
a O
hurry O

Our O
room O
was O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
above O
the O
outside O
bar O
so O
noise B-AS
and O
smoke B-AS
were O
a O
problem B-OP
at O
night O

We O
have O
spent O
4 O
weeks O
in O

Europe O
and O
this O
place B-AS
was O
the O
most B-OP
disappointing I-OP

The O
location B-AS
was O
great B-OP

Right B-OP
in I-OP
the O
city B-AS
center I-AS

Many B-OP
restaurants B-AS
are O
near O
by O
the O
hotel O
and O
museums O

Had O
to O
insist O
on O
moving O
rooms O
as O
room B-AS
was O
dirty B-OP
e O
g O
mould O
on O
walls O
and O
shower O
curtain O
the O
final O
room B-AS
was O
just O
about O
acceptable B-OP
but O
did O
not O
deserve O
a O
4 O
star O
rating O
and O
was O
very B-OP
overpriced I-OP

Very B-OP
clean I-OP
location B-AS
was O
excellent B-OP

With O
one O
exception O
reception B-AS
staff I-AS
poor B-OP
Geraldo O
and O
Jasper O
poor O

I O
showed O
them O
the O
email O
confirmation O
of O
the O
revised O
booking O
on O
my O
phone O
and O
they O
asked O
me O
to O
forward O
to O
them O
before O
they O
reluctantly O
took O
off O
the O
charge O

They O
were O
the O
best O

Good B-OP
food B-AS
at I-AS
breakfast I-AS
and O
dinner I-AS

Executive B-AS
Lounge I-AS
is O
nice B-OP
touch I-OP

Nice B-OP
rooms B-AS

I O
would O
classify O
it O
as O
a O
3 O
star O
instead O
of O
four O
stars O
for O
expectation O
management O

Nice B-OP
hotel B-AS
nice B-OP
services B-AS
nice O

It O
does O
sit O
on O
a O
tram B-AS
line I-AS
literally O
across B-OP
the I-OP
street I-OP
so O
access B-AS
to I-AS
Amsterdam I-AS
was O
fast B-OP
and O
easy B-OP

Also O
because O
it O
was O
away B-OP
from I-OP
downtown B-AS
a O
little O
bit O

It O
was O
an O
okay B-OP
hotel B-AS
but O
there O
are O
better O
for O
the O
money O

R O
epitome O
staff B-AS
extremely B-OP
pleasant I-OP
and O
helpful B-OP

so O
convenient B-OP

Breakfast B-AS
is O
a O
relaxed B-OP
uncomplicated I-OP
experience B-AS
waiters O
don O
t O
hover O
around O
eyeing O
you O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
re O
even O
allowed O
to O
have O
breakfast O

Also O
the O
pantry O
is O
such O
a O
nice B-OP
touch B-AS

Loved B-OP
this O
hotel B-AS

Small B-OP
room B-AS
sloped B-OP
roof B-AS
light I-AS
shining I-AS
in O
poor B-OP
blind B-AS
and O
curtains O

Carpet B-AS
pretty B-OP
stained I-OP
and O
just O
seems B-OP
tired I-OP

Most O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
were O
amazing B-OP
but O
experienced B-OP
an O
incident O
where O
service O
was O
somewhat O
sub O
par O
in O
the O
bar O
and O
this O
is O
why O

I O
did O
not O
give O
staff O
perfect O
score O

I O
asked O
for O
blankets O
for O
outside O
and O
the O
bar O
tender O
told O
me O
he O
just O
put O
them O
away O

The O
view B-AS
was O
amazing B-OP

Staff B-AS
were O
freindly B-OP

Very B-OP
nice I-OP
and O
professional B-OP
staff B-AS
especially O
people O
in O
the O
reception O

It O
was O
about B-OP
300 I-OP
meters I-OP
to I-OP
the O
tram B-AS
and O
the O
bus B-AS

so O
we O
had O
to O
prop O
it O

The O
hotel O
itself O
is O
in O
a O
building O
that O
also O
has O
other O
residents O
a O
dental O
practice O
some O
kids O
facility O
etc O

Identifying O
the O
reception O
for O
the O
hotel O
which O
was O
in O
the O
4th O
floor O
itself O
was O
an O
achievement O

I O
would O
happily O
have O
stayed O
at O
the O
less O
expensive O
alternative O
for O
the O
whole O
stay O
in O
order O
not O
to O
have O
changed O
room O

Bed B-AS
was O
to O
soft B-OP
Cleanness O
not O
100 O
given O
especially O
on O
the O
balcony O

Price O
to O
high O
if O
you O
consider O
cleanness O
of O
bathroom O
balcony O
and O
the O
position O
of O
hotel O
outside O
of O
Amsterdam O
Downtown O
Didn O
t O
try O
breakfast O
because O
of O
high B-OP
price B-AS
better O
eat O
in O

Amsterdam O
Downtown O

The O
bed B-AS
was O
comfy B-OP
and O
the O
room B-AS
has O
plenty B-OP
of I-OP
natural B-AS
light I-AS
and O
space B-AS

Style O
of O
hotel B-AS
reastaurant B-AS
and O
bar B-AS
were O
fantastic B-OP

Staff B-AS
went O
above O
and O
beyond B-OP
extremely I-OP
helpful I-OP
and O
friendly B-OP

After O
being O
seated O
in O
the O
hotel O
s O
cafe O
we O
had O
to O
wait B-AS
over O
20 B-OP
minutes I-OP
for O
a O
waiter O
to O
take O
our O
drinks O
order O

The O
reception B-AS
staff I-AS
were O
friendly B-OP
but O
were O
not B-OP
very I-OP
efficient I-OP
either O

The O
breakfast B-AS
was O
also O
very B-OP
expensive I-OP
even O
though O
there O
was O
not B-OP
much I-OP
choice I-OP

Lovely B-OP
staff B-AS
very B-OP
helpful I-OP

Room B-AS
is O
too B-OP
small I-OP

In O
an O
area O
that O
is O
more O
neighborly O
than O
touristy O

Worth O
going O
to O
Concertblow O
for O
a O
concert O

I O
am O
putting O
this O
in O
the O

that O
s O
not O
to O
say O
that O

I O
didn O
t O
like O
the O
location B-AS
but O
that O
you O

although O
the O

Always O
thought O
about O

in O

Amsterdam O
Glad O

My O

but O
beds B-AS
weren B-OP
t I-OP
comfortable I-OP

a O

stay B-AS
since O
the O

looking B-AS
hotel O

Very B-OP
helpful I-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
stuff B-AS

The O
location B-AS
was O
perfect B-OP
we O
loved B-OP
the O
garden B-AS
beside O
the O
hotel O
very B-OP
nice I-OP
spot B-AS
to O
relax O
and O
enjoy O
the O

breakfast B-AS
plenty B-OP
of I-OP
public B-AS
transport I-AS

nearby O

left O
me O
out O
of O
pocket O
and O
stressed O

No B-OP
shops B-AS
nearby O
to O
buy O
things O

The O
location O
is O
my O
main O
concern O
then O
the O
building B-AS
is O
outdated B-OP

The O
curtain B-AS
is O
turn B-OP
and O
patched B-OP

The O

extended O
to O
run O
for O
maybe O
at O
least O
15 O
minutes O
before O
they O
switch O
off O

it O
would O
be O
perfect O

Not O
all O
rooms O
come O
with O
the O
eco O
friendly O
bathroom O
though O
only O
a O
few O
do O

The O
upside O
though O
is O
that O
this O
bathroom B-AS
is O
more B-OP
spacious I-OP
compared O
to O
the O
one O
in O
another O
room O
we O
booked O
we O
booked O
the O
same O
type O

Decoration B-AS
of O
the O
room O
was O
pretty B-OP
poor I-OP
and O
the O
breakfast B-AS
could O
have O
been O
better B-OP

Also O
price B-AS
quality I-AS
ratio I-AS
was O
poor B-OP
since O
the O
demand O
for O

Amsterdam O
hotels O
were O
high O
at O
that O
time O

The O
location B-AS
was O
perfect B-OP
and O
despite O
the O
close B-OP
vicinity B-AS
to I-AS
the I-AS

silent B-OP

Free B-OP

I O
had O
a O
problem B-OP
with O
the O
staff B-AS
when O

I O
arrived O

The O
size O
of O
the O
room B-AS
and O
bathroom B-AS
was O
amazing B-OP
studio O
kitchen O
was O
fully O
fitted O

Great B-OP
sized I-OP
shower B-AS

went O
out O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
and O
got O
back O

the O
time O
around O
3:00 PM O
with O
a O

of O
receptionist O

Staff B-AS
were O
very B-OP
friendly I-OP
indeed O
made O
up O
for O
the O
poor B-OP
room B-AS

The O
staff B-AS
was O
great B-OP
good B-OP
location B-AS

And O
it O
could O
have O
been O
easily O
avoided O
if O
they O
had O
mentioned O
the O
issue O
upon O
check O
in O

The O
price B-AS
is O
a B-OP
bit I-OP
expensive I-OP
comparing O
to O
other O
hotels O

We O
really O
appreciated O
Ava O
and O

Leo O

We O
overlooked B-OP
the O
station B-AS
the O
canal B-AS
and O
the O
city O

Room B-AS
was O
huge B-OP
but O
had O
an O
awkward B-OP
layout B-AS

Location O
Some O
effort O
to O
walk O
to O
and O
from O
the O
tram O
stop O
but O
we O
didn O
t O
mind O

Wow O
what B-OP
a I-OP
place B-AS

I O
don O
t O
know O
how O
we O
will O
ever O
be O
able O
to O
stay O
anywhere O
else O
in O

Amsterdam O
after O
staying O
here O

The O
room B-AS
was O
comfy B-OP
clean O

Still O
being O
refurbished B-OP
so O
lots O
of O
boxes O
around O
the O
room O
still O
had O
the O
odd O
little O
snagging O
issue O
but O
not O
a O
problem O
for O
us O

Both O

s O
also O
tea B-AS

with O
a O

On O
the O

I O
was O

only O

the O

Room B-AS

trams O
to O
get O

from O
but O
the O
trams O
were O
plentiful B-OP
a O
shuttle B-AS
bus I-AS
would O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
the O
food B-AS
in O
the O
restaurant B-AS
was O
very B-OP
limited I-OP
and O
not B-OP
very I-OP
good I-OP
which O
was O
a O
problem O
because O
there O
is O
no O
where O
else O
to O
go O

The O

at O
the O

while O

a O
brilliant B-OP
idea I-OP

he O
insisted O
his O
opinion O
and O
ask O
us O
to O
show O
him O
prove O
in O

Of O
course O
we O
didn O
t O
have O
it O
in O

and O
he O
looked O
at O
us O
as O
if O
we O

get O
some O
advantage O

A O

Beautiful B-OP

When O

booking O

I O
have O
requested O
if O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
upgrade O
to O
a O
room O
with O
bath O
tub O

The O
reply O
from O
the O
hotel O
was O
it O
is O
possible O
to O
arrange O
but O
can O
not O
guarantee O

We O
have O
arrived O
early O
the O
check O
in O
day O
around O
9:00 AM O
informed O
by O
the O
receptionist O
that O
we O
have O
been O
upgraded O
for O
free O
to O
an O
executive O
room O
which O
is O
still O
under O

so O
we O
would O
have O

for O
the O

in O

We O

Good B-OP

separate O
toilet O
to O
the O

which O
was O
very B-OP
small I-OP

Room O
was O
at O
the O
back O
of O
the O
hotel O
backing O
into O
a O
noisy B-OP
and O
busy B-OP
room B-AS
but O
this O
did O
not O
distract O
from O
our O
stay O
would O
stay O
here O
again O

The O
rooms B-AS
were O
not B-OP
great I-OP
but O
not B-OP
bad I-OP
either O

The O
bathroom O
did O
not B-OP
have I-OP
a O
lock B-AS

The O
view B-AS
to I-AS
the I-AS
canal I-AS
was O
very B-OP
nice I-OP

The O

were O
really B-OP

the O
hotel B-AS
itself O
was O
laidback B-OP

I O
didn O
t O
like O
that O
the O
location B-AS
was O
a B-OP
bit I-OP
far I-OP
out I-OP
than O

I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O

The O
hotel O
is O
very O
proud O
with O
it O

The O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
the O

Unfortunately O
with O

1 O
night O

we O
didn O
t O
have O
time O
to O
make O
use O
of O
the O

next O
time O

I O
would O
recommend O
renting O
the O
bicycles O
you O
can O
do O
this O
from O
the O
reception O
and O
cycling O
up O
the O

to O

Great B-OP

all B-AS
Amsterdam I-AS

Hotel O

AC O

Too B-OP
Dark I-OP
in O
the O

some O

The O

the O

wonderful B-OP
the O
bed B-AS
was O
super B-OP
comfy I-OP
the O
all O

was O
well O
worth O
it O
breakfast O
cheese O

open O

One O
minor O
drawback O
here O
is O
that O
fellow O
guests O
seem O
to O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
close O
their O
room O
doors O
quietly O

No B-OP
armchair B-AS
in O
the O
room O
there O
would O
be O
enough O
space O
for O

we O
reserved O

The O
light B-AS
switches I-AS
were O
dirty B-OP
and O
the O

was O
smelling B-OP
like I-OP
stagnant I-OP
urine O
as O
it O
was O
not B-OP
cleaned I-OP
for I-OP
weeks I-OP

We O
had O
to O
stay O
the O
night O
since O
we O
werd O

The O
hotel B-AS
and O
our O
room B-AS
was O
great B-OP
and O
very B-OP
unique I-OP

The O
location B-AS
was O
perfect B-OP
as O
well O

when O
I O
got O
there O

I O
was O
asked O
to O
pay O
600 O

Euros O
save O
yourself O
the O
hassle O
and O
go O
elsewhere O

The O
staff B-AS
were O
so O
friendly B-OP
and O
accomodating B-OP

For O
the O
3 O
days O
they O
clean O
the O
room O
but O
they O
didn O
t O
change O
the O
bed O
sheet O

A B-OP
lot I-OP
of I-OP
Mosquitos B-AS
and O
no B-OP
air B-AS

didn O
t O
sleep O
well O

The O
hotel O
provided O
a O

but O
it O
didn O
t O
get O
the O
job O
done O

Other O
than O
that O
the O
other O
things O
were O
fine O

Ended O
up O
paying O
40 O
more O
per O
night O
then O
original O
quote O

Rooms B-AS
were O
tiny B-OP
Elevator B-AS
slow B-OP
walls B-AS
very B-OP
thin I-OP
Housekeeping O
annoying O
w O

Everything B-AS
is O
within B-OP
walking I-OP

Desk B-AS
staff I-AS
were O

helpful B-OP

The O

was O
well O
placed O
in O
a O

for O

The O
housekeeping B-AS
in O

Stayed O
here O
for O
3 O

but O
everyday O
noticed O
that O
only O
the O
beds B-AS
were B-OP
done I-OP
and O
the O
garbage B-AS
bins I-AS
cleared B-OP

Nothing O
else O
besides O
this O

Don O
t O
think O
the O
room O
was O
even O
being O
dusted O
or O
swept O
as O
bits O
of O
paper O
n O
dust O
used O
to O

has O
a O
great B-OP
location B-AS
being O
close B-OP

the I-OP
train B-AS
and O
central B-AS
Amsterdam I-AS

Earlier B-OP
check B-AS
in I-AS
would O
help O

I O
think O
when O
a O
hotel O
advertises O
pool B-AS
and O
saunas B-AS
these O
should O
be O
included O
in O
the O
price O
otherwise O
they O
can O
not O
really O
be O
considered O
a O
hotel O
facility O
you O
might O
as O
well O
use O
a O
full O
wellness O
place O
like O
Sauna O
Deco O
which O
we O
did O

Pool O
was O
included O
but O
there O
was O
a O
cost O
to O
using O
the O
saunas O

The O
restaurant B-AS
serves O
excellent B-OP
breakfast B-AS
and O
dinner B-AS

the O
comfortable B-OP
staying B-AS
and O
the O

I O
m O
very O
shocked O
that O
the O
shower O
was O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O

I O
assumed O
that O
it O
was O
just O
advertisement O
and O
they O
would O
have O
normal O
bathrooms O
but O
apparently O
not O

This O
really O
made O
me O
feel O
uncomfortable O
as O

I O
had O
to O
shower O
in O
front O
of O
my O
partner O

Very B-OP

no B-OP

I O
just O
can O
t O
believe O
they O
would O
even O
build O
a O
hotel O
more O
than O
15 O
minutes O
away O
from O
the O

I O
also O
feel O
like O

I O
need O
to O
blame O
the O
hotel O
for O
the O
smell O
of O
marijuana O
in O
the O
city O
as O

I O
have O
no O
one O
else O
to O
blame O
for O
that O

The O
assistant B-AS
manager I-AS
was O
extremely B-OP
nice I-OP
and O
took B-OP
care I-OP
of I-OP
us I-OP
and O
our O
issues O
with O
the O

was O

at O
the O
beginning O

The O

cool B-OP
helpful B-OP

The O
rooms B-AS

the O
common B-AS

were O
all O
very B-OP

The O
metro B-AS

the O

were O
only B-OP
two I-OP
minute I-OP
away I-OP
and O
it O
felt B-AS
really O
safe B-OP
to O
ride O
the O
metro O
even O
during O
the O
evening O

We O
re O
coming O
back O

Lovely B-OP
hotel B-AS
with O
really O
friendly B-OP
staff B-AS

We O
were O
checked O
in O
in O
a O
downgrade O
room O
and O
not O
the O
type O
of O
room O

Staff B-AS
were O
extremely B-OP
helpful I-OP

The O
location B-AS
is O
terrible B-OP

Breakfast B-AS
was O
a O
disaster B-OP

The O
service B-AS
staff I-AS
were O
inattentive B-OP
rude I-OP
and O
really O
not B-OP
interested I-OP
to O
make O
the O
experience O
an O
enjoyable O
one O

Not O
at O
all O
what O
one O
expects O
from O
a O
5 O

It O
was O
as O
if O
they O
were O
intended O
for O
twin O
beds O
which O
is O
what O
it O
ended O
up O
feeling O
like O

The O
second O
is O
regarding O
the O
shower O
gel O

The O
hotel O
provides O
a O
dispenser O
on O
the O
wall O
in O
the O
shower O
rather O
than O
as O
a O
separate O
single O
use O
bottle O

I O
have O
only O
ever O
seen O
this O
been O
done O
in O
the O
Ibis O
hotels O
so O
it O
came O
across O
as O
cheap O
and O
not O
what O

I O
would O
have O
expected O
from O
a O
4 O
star O
hotel O

I O
do O
however O
see O
the O
argument O
that O
this O
method O
of O
dispensing O
the O
shower O
gel O
is O
more O
environmental O
which O
is O
why O

I O
would O
not O
complain O
about O
it O

Although O
we O
wanted O
to O
have O
the O
experience O
of O
riding O
bikes O
to O
city O
center O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
cold O
for O
us O

t O
think O

you O
all O
were O
awesome B-OP
to O
accommodate B-AS
our O

We O

a O
great B-OP
time B-AS
here O

indeed O
a O
nice B-OP
place B-AS

had O
a O
large B-OP

this O
place B-AS
easily B-OP
accommodated I-OP
all O
16 O
of O
us O
. O

They O
dragged O
their O
feet O
and O
finally O
gave O
me O
a O
1800 O

to O
call O
. O

Traditional B-OP
experience B-AS
from O

I O
do O
not O
understand O
the O
extra B-OP
miscellaneous I-OP
fees B-AS
for O
the O

event O
. O

Nothing B-OP
wrong I-OP
with O
the O
room B-AS
- O

The O
lock B-AS
on O
the O
door O
would O
also O
not B-OP
secure I-OP
so O
I O
had O
to O
push O
the O
office O
chair O
against O
the O
door O
. O

Even O
the O
check O
- O
in O
clerk O
made O
a O
joke O
about O
us O
looking O
lost O
, O
we O
were O
. O

Took O
us O
a O
while O
to O
find O
the O
place B-AS
, O
it O
’s O
hidden B-OP
a O
little O

Every O
time O
I O

I O
get O
a O
response B-AS
back B-OP
very I-OP
quickly I-OP

In O
general O
, O
you O

Our O
room B-AS
was O
beautiful B-OP

I O
wish O
I O
could O

because O
you O

This O

advice O
pick O
any O
other O

this O
is O
the O
worst O

The O
space B-AS
is O
rather B-OP
serene I-OP
and O
focus O
on O
natural B-OP
elements I-AS
in O
their O
decor B-AS
and O
food B-AS
. O

Is O
it O
the O
memories O
or O
is O
it O
real O
? O

Maybe O
it O
was O
an O
exceptional O
case O
, O
do O
n't O

For O
example O
, O
lunch B-AS

The O

very B-OP
poor I-OP

it O

awful O
to O

more B-OP

A O

I O
booked O
a O
Princess B-AS

and O
that O
's O
how O
we O
were O
treated O
. O

They O
would O
be O
in O
the O

cleaning O
sounded O
more O
like O
they O
were O
worried O
about O
their O
social O
lives O
than O
cleaning O

However O
, O
if O
you O

This O

The O

The O

Although O
if O
visiting O

would O
choose O
Edgewater O
, O
Aquarius O
or O
any O
of O
the O
others O
first O
, O
as O
Harrahs O
is O
away B-OP
from I-OP
most B-AS
of I-AS
the I-AS
activities I-AS
available I-AS
in O
this O
great B-OP
little I-OP
town B-AS
. O

People B-AS
complained B-OP
about O
the O
cost B-AS
- O
but O
for O
all O
you O
get O

Place B-AS
was O
nice B-OP
family B-AS
had O
good B-OP
time B-AS

Avoid B-OP
this O
hostel B-AS
if O
at O
all O
possible O
. O

We O
had O
several O
other O
pieces O
of O
exceptional B-OP
service B-AS
, O
including O
transportation B-AS
that O
was O
arranged O
, O
that O
all O
went O
off O
without O
a O
hitch O
. O

Love B-OP
this O
hotel B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
... O
has O
gone B-OP
down I-OP
since O
they O
changed O
the O
cafeteria B-AS
area I-AS
up O
. O

I O
moved O
to O

give O

a O
10 B-OP

and O
I O
always O
come O
here O
, O
so O

Other O
than O
that O
, O
the O
lifts B-AS
are O
OK B-OP
when O
you O
spread O
around O
the O
mountain O
. O

Prices B-AS
reflect O
the O
monopolistic B-OP
nature B-AS
of O
the O
place O
: O
do O
n't O
look O
at O
the O
price O
when O
ordering O
your O
food O
otherwise O
it O
will O
have O
a O
sour B-OP
taste B-AS

The O
shuttle B-AS
driver I-AS
was O
also O
unprofessional B-OP
carrying O
on O
a O
personal B-OP
conversation B-AS
on O
his O
cell O
phone O
. O

When O
we O
were O
n't O
out O
enjoying B-OP
the O
village B-AS
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
relax B-OP
in O
the O
room B-AS
with O
the O
air B-AS
conditioning I-AS
and O
cable B-AS
TV I-AS
. O

It O
was O
muggy B-OP
and O
stuffy B-OP
when O
we O
returned O
. O

They O
let O
me O
check O
my O
bag O
while O
I O
played O
until O
time O
to O
leave O
for O
my O
flight O
home O
and O
no O
charge O
for O
checking O
flight O
info O
and O
printing O
boarding O
passes O
to O
avoid O
it O
at O
the O
airport O
. O

Just O
look O
at O
the O
other O
reviews O
and O
ask O
yourself O
do O
the O
look O
like O
real O
people O
? O

This O
was O
our O
family O

first O
time O
in O

just B-OP
poor I-OP
food B-AS
unless O
you O
go O

of O
the O
overpriced B-OP

, O
Egyptian B-AS
theme I-AS

I O
enjoy B-OP
the O

too O
, O
who O
are O
always B-OP
servicable I-OP
and O
nice B-OP
. O

Seriously O
- O
the O

amazingly B-OP
bad I-OP

An O
amazing B-OP

We O

we O
decided O
to O
eat O
dinner O
at O
the O
hotel O
resteraunt O
, O
the O
service B-AS
was O
exceptional B-OP
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
NOT B-OP
worth I-OP
the I-OP
money I-OP
. O

Came O
here O
for O
a O
show O
and O
just O
really B-OP
enjoyed I-OP
the O

As O
a O
night B-AS
club I-AS
( O
later O
in O
the O
night O
) O
, O
the O
music B-AS
is O
not B-OP
great I-OP
, O
and O
the O
crowd B-AS
can O
a O
bit B-OP
creepy I-OP
: O
drunk B-OP
girls B-AS
, O
pushy B-OP
men B-AS
, O
french B-OP

One O
of O
the O
favorite B-OP
locals B-AS
stops O
for O
the O

When O
complaining O
at O

about O
that O
, O
the O
stuff B-AS
was O
quite B-OP
unfriendly I-OP
stating O
that O
no O
other O

available O
. O

THANK O
YOU O
to O
this O
hotel O
for O
making O
our O
much B-OP
anticipated I-OP
and O
well B-OP
deserved I-OP
vacation B-AS
more O
than O
we O
could O
have O
ever O
hoped O
for O
. O

We O
did O
book O
with O
short O
notice O
so O
overall O
, O
it O
was O
a O
good B-OP
experience B-AS
. O

It O
's O
super B-OP
fun I-OP
, O
the O
hotel B-AS
service I-AS
is O
awesome B-OP
. O

The O
valet B-AS
service I-AS
was O
very B-OP
poor I-OP
for O
the O
price O
we O
paid O
to O
park O
our O
car O
with O
the O
hotel O
. O

It O
has O
a O
great B-OP
rough I-OP
lux B-AS
feel I-AS
to O
it O
and O
the O
first O
time O
I O
went O
they O
had O
some O
great B-OP
live I-OP
musicians B-AS
playing O

The O

were O
rude B-OP
, O
too O
. O

Views B-AS

Oh O

actually O
that O
welcoming O
either O
. O

, O
it O
was O
terrible B-OP
, O
I O
have O
to O
request O
to O
change O

! O
! O

Caesar B-AS

Loews O

because O
they O
are O
pet B-OP
friendly I-OP
.. O
never O
again O
! O

We O
stayed O
on O
the O
second O
floor O
and O
had O
a O
private B-OP
entrance B-AS
to O
an O
outdoor B-AS
deck I-AS
, O
which O
was O
perfect B-OP
for O
2 O
biking O
enthusiasts O
! O

The O
reat B-AS
of O
the O
hotel B-AS
has O
a O
nice B-OP
smart I-OP
touch I-OP
to O
it O
. O

I O
would O
rather O
have O
saved O
the O
money O
and O
eaten O
at O
a O
resteraunt O
out O
of O
the O
hotel O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
over B-OP
- I-OP
crowded I-OP
with O
french B-OP
tourists B-AS
, O
and O
you O
can O
see O
the O
french O

Close B-OP

Got O
stuck O
in O
Calgary O
then O
CHI O
and O
then O
to O
Dallas O
and O
tired O
and O
cranky O
, O
arrived O
at O
230 O
am O
after O
i O
had O
to O
take O
a O
cab O
there O
, O
bc O
they O
did O
nt O
have O
any O
shuttles O
but O
somehow O
we O
followed O
the O
shuttle O
from O
the O
airport O
to O
the O
hotel B-AS
which O
contained O
passengers O
, O
UNREAL B-OP
. O

hello O
had O
the O
experience O
of O
staying O
in O
the O
hotel O
just O
recently O
between O
11/11 O
- O
22/11 O
. O

Obviously O
it O
was O
a O
little O
late O
, O
but O
you O
never O
know O
what O
will O
happen O
next O
year O
. O

BED B-AS
BUGS I-AS
! O

Never O
would O
have O
been O
on O
this O
street O
if O
not O
for O
this O
place O
. O

They O
suggested O
to O
move O
to O
another O
room O
, O
go O
to O
hospital O
or O
look O
for O
another O
hotel O

Friendly B-OP
staff B-AS
. O

The O
room B-AS
was O
pretty B-OP
clean I-OP
, O
could O
use O
a O
little B-OP
updating I-OP
as O
my O
wife O
not B-OP
thrilled I-OP
about O
mauve B-AS

Indoor B-OP
pool B-AS
+ O
hot B-OP
tub B-AS
. O

I O
HIGHLY B-OP
recommend I-OP
staying O
at O
the O
Reserve B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
awful B-OP
, O
our O
server B-AS
never O
brought O
us O
the O
drinks O
we O
ordered O
from O
the O
bar O
an O
hour O
after O
we O
ordered O
them O
, O
and O
we O
ended O
up O
leaving O
the O
show O
before O
it O
even O
began O
because O
we O
were O
so O
appalled O
. O

Being O
of O
sound O
mind O
and O
free O
will O
, O
I O
can O
honestly O
say O
the O
Ryugyong B-AS
Hotel I-AS
is O
the O
greatest B-OP
structure B-AS
ever O
built O
by O
man O
. O

We O
got O
a O
room O
for O
$ O
85 O
in O
August O
. O

SO O
you O
basically O
only O
see O
the O
Empire O
State O
Building O
and O
the O
golden B-OP
roof B-AS
of O
the O
Credit O
Suisse O
building O
. O

Stayed O
December O
2012 O

Biggest O
complaint O
was O
for O
other O
people O
we O
were O
with O
. O

I O
gather O
that O
if O
you O
have O
enough B-OP
cocktails B-AS
, O
you O
shall O
indeed O
be O
amazing O
( O
or O
something O
else O
on O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
spectrum O
, O
but O
that O
's O
outside O
the O
scope O
of O
this O
positive O
review O
) O
. O

and O
I O
wanted O
to O
do O
something O
a O
little O
different O
than O
your O
typical O
hotel O
. O

the O
staff B-AS
is O
also O
very B-OP
courteous I-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
. O

Awesome B-OP
place B-AS
for I-AS
live B-OP
music B-AS
! O

The O
restaurant B-AS
is O
outdated B-OP
and O
looks B-OP
very B-OP
old I-OP
and O
reminds O
me O
of O
an O
Ihop O
in O
sense O
of O
decor O
. O

However O
, O
stay O
away O
from O
the O
indoor B-AS
pool I-AS
, O
the O
area B-AS
is O
very B-OP
run I-OP
down I-OP
. O

I O
stayed O
here O
for O
a O
conference O
and O
was O
pleasantly B-OP
surprised I-OP
. O

Disgusting B-OP
staff B-AS
. O

This O
was O
absolutely O
the O
worse B-OP
hotel B-AS
I O
have O
stayed O
at O
. O

Is O
this O
hotel O
ghetto O
? O

We O
decided O
to O
take O
it O
with O
the O
police O
. O

So O
imagine O
two O
families O
in O
a O
suite O
with O
two O
beds O
. O

Really B-OP
impressive I-OP
across B-AS
the I-AS
board I-AS
. O

Sure O
, O
it O
's O
a O
holiday B-OP
destination B-AS
, O
but O
we O
were O
expecting B-OP
more O
from O
the O
Keys O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
expectations O
and O
other O
people O
's O
recommendations O
. O

” O
sign O
lit O
behind O
the O
bar O
. O

The O
hotel B-AS
is O
a B-OP
bit I-OP
grungy I-OP
. O

Skip O
the O
overpriced B-OP
food B-AS
inside O
and O
sit O
outside O
. O

Room B-AS
was O
tidy B-OP
and O
very B-OP
comfy I-OP
, O
complete B-OP
lack I-OP
of O
phone B-AS
signal I-AS
in O
the O
room O
was O
annoying B-OP
but O
nothing O
they O
can O
do O
. O

PARTE O
NUEVA O
SI O
ESTÁN O
AL O
DÍA O
PERO O

Overall O
..... O
great B-OP
hotel B-AS
. O

The O
food B-AS
was O
out B-OP
to I-OP
us I-OP
very I-OP
quickly I-OP
, O
and O
we O
enjoyed B-OP
the O
Pierhouse B-AS
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
came O
here O
while O
barhopping O
on O
New O
Years O
Eve O
. O

This O
time O
we O
had O
a O
two O
bedroom O
apartment O
with O
an O
equally B-OP
stunning I-OP
view B-AS
as O
our O
first O
visit O
. O

We O
hit O
the O
American O
Werewolf O
in O
London O
, O
Cabin O
in O
the O
Woods O
, O
Evil O
Dead O
, O
and O
Resident O
Evil O
houses O
as O
well O

VERY B-OP
clean I-OP
, O
Very B-OP
friendly I-OP
and O
laid B-AS
out I-AS
VERY B-OP
well I-OP
. O

Everything B-AS
in O
the O
restaurant B-AS
is O
special B-OP
. O

We O
enjoyed B-OP
our O
stay B-AS
in O
Berlin O
and O
found O
a O
lovely B-OP
hotel B-AS
which O
helped O
us O
to O
get O
a O
perfect B-OP
experience B-AS
. O

They O
were O
very B-OP
nice I-OP
and O
upgraded B-AS
us O
to O
the O
new O
tower O
at O
no B-OP
cost I-OP
with O
adjoining O
rooms O
, O
which O
the O
kids B-AS
loved B-OP
. O

A O
good B-OP
place B-AS
to O
be O
. O

Lets O
start O
with O
the O
View B-AS
, O
it O
is O
extremely B-OP
nice I-OP
to O
look O
over O
all O
of O
Atlanta O

a O
very B-OP
cool I-OP
, O
very B-OP
trendy I-OP
hotel B-AS
. O

We O
were O
here O
for O
a O
wedding O
and O
it O
was O
great O
that O
they O
had O
a O
room O
block O
here O
to O
make O
things O
convenient O
. O

Was O
very B-OP
well I-OP
, O
they O
should O
change O
the O
breakfast B-AS
daily O
because O
always O
was O
the O
same O
. O

Great B-OP
service B-AS
starts O
with O
a O
great B-OP
bartender B-AS
who O
gets O
you O
water O
without O
asking O
and O
comps O
one O
of O
your O
drinks O
for O
lack O
of O
communication O
by O
the O
previous O
bartender O
who O
failed O
to O
inform O
you O
that O
they O
were O
only O
serving O
cheese O
and O
dessert O
at O
930pm O
. O

I O
then O
spoke O
to O
a O
manager O
afterwards O
( O
Larry O
) O
to O
give O
feedback O
, O
who O
really O
did O

I O
am O
from O
PA O
( O
on O
my O

I O

that O

of O
the O
best B-OP
Chicken B-AS
Cheese I-AS
Steak I-AS
sandwiches I-AS
I O
have O
ever O

Everything B-AS
is O
relaxing B-OP
and O
wonderfull B-OP
. O

Go O
to O
place O
when O
having O
no O
plans O
on O
the O
weekend O
. O

But O
once O
I O
picked O
my O
seat O
my O
server B-AS
seemed B-OP
friendly I-OP
. O

That O
was O
when O
Becky O
first O
began O
attending O
to O
my O
numerous O
needs O
with O
regard O
to O
package O
options O
, O
and O
my O
extensive O
requests O
to O

Michael O

but O
you O
find O
all O
the O
first B-OP
class I-OP
amenities B-AS
you O
need O
. O

Wonderful B-OP
customer B-AS
service I-AS
, O
caring B-OP
and O
respectful B-OP
. O

Bathrooms B-AS
are O
crap B-OP
and O
seem B-OP
rarely I-OP
cleaned I-OP
down O
by O
the O
cafeteria O
. O

Ca B-OP
n't I-OP
beat I-OP
the O
price B-AS
. O

A O
nice B-OP
place B-AS
to O
get O
away O
from O
the O
tourists B-AS
and O
out O
of O
the O
sun O
. O

The O
air B-AS
conditioning I-AS
was O
a O
welcome B-OP
reprieve I-OP
from O
the O
heat O
of O
summer O
, O
and O
my O
Mother O
loved B-OP
the O
Austar B-AS
selection I-AS
of O
tv O
American O
tv O

They O
had O
an O
excuse O
for O
everything O
. O

Just O
like O
I O
expected O
. O

We O
like B-OP
it O
because O
it O
is O
close B-OP
to I-OP
Disneyland B-AS
and O
it O
is O
right B-OP
off I-OP
the O
freeway B-AS
. O

On O
the O
plus O
side O
, O
their O
pool B-AS
deck I-AS
is O
beautiful B-OP
( O
and O
not O
stinky O
! O
) O
. O

I O
was O
told O
that O
$ O
50 O
would O
process O
on O
my O
card O
, O
but O
then O
would O
never O
be O
taken O
off O
if O
nothing O
was O
wrong O
with O
the O
room O
. O

waitress O
do O
a O
good B-OP
job I-OP
finding O
you O
in O
the O
crowd O
. O

You O
'll O
be O
doing O
yourself O
a O
GREAT B-OP
disserve B-AS
if O
you O
do O
n’t O
. O

The O
food B-AS
is O
overpriced B-OP
, O
not B-OP
a I-OP
good I-OP
selection B-AS
& O
its O
not B-OP
kid B-AS
friendly O
which O
was O
surprising O
. O

they O
have O
a O
racket B-AS
going B-OP
where O
they O
only B-OP
provide O
a O
handful O
of O
service B-AS
carts I-AS
, O
and O
only O
have O
availability O
on O
bell O
carts O
. O

Front B-AS
desk I-AS
was O
helpful B-OP
, O
my O
grandfather O
uses O
a O
walker O

so O
we O
had O
no O
problems O
with O
queuing O
for O
anything O

The O
deco B-AS
of O
the O
hotel B-AS
is O
very B-OP
modern I-OP
and O
the O
shower B-AS
is O
an O
amazing B-OP
experience B-AS
. O

You O
have O
easy B-OP
access B-AS
to O
the O
beach B-AS
across O
the O
street O
. O

That O
's O
pretty O
much O
it O
... O

Conveniently B-OP
located O
downstairs B-AS
is O
hospitable B-OP
and O
yummy B-OP
restaurant B-AS
service I-AS
. O

The O
windows B-AS
are O
old B-OP
and O
bang B-OP
quite I-OP
a I-OP
bit I-OP
in O
the O
night O
on O
windy O
nights O
. O

Me O
and O
another O
guest O
were O
bit O
several O
times O
. O

Highly B-OP
recommended I-OP
! O

we O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
single O
bad O
meal B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
went O
to O
great B-OP
lengths I-OP
to O
impress O
and O
treat O
my O
parents O
like B-OP
VIPs B-AS
. O

I O
would O
not B-OP
recommend I-OP
this O
hotel B-AS

It O
's O
fun B-OP
for O
kiddos O
and O
relaxing B-OP
for O
adults O
. O

We O
were O
told O
the O
shuttle O
service O
was O
available O
to O
take O
us O
to O
a O
local O
convenient O
store O
for O
toiletries O
, O
however O
when O
we O
left O
the O
store O
the O
shuttle O
was O
nowhere B-OP
in O
sight O
when O
we O
called O
the O
hotel O
to O
let O
them O
know O
they O
told O
us O
that O
the O
shuttle O
driver O
's O
shift O
was O
over O
, O
and O
we O
were O
forced O
to O
find O
another O
way O
back O
to O
the O
hotel O
. O

, O
so O
I O
knew O
it O
was O
n't O
going O
to O
be O
particularly O
thrilling O
, O
but O
if O
you O
're O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
movie O
you O
might O
get O
a O
little B-OP
worked O
up O
riding O
over O
the O
Californian B-AS
town B-AS
and O
through O
the O
stars O
. O
) O

Do O
n't O
let O
their O
ambling O
fool O

Conveniently B-OP
located I-OP
in O
the O
heart O
of O
downtown O
. O

Your O
soul O
will O
demand O
another O
dosa O
. O

I O
recommend B-OP
this O
place B-AS
for O
a O
show O
or O
grabbing O
a O
drink O
and O
hanging O
out O
. O

We O
were O
charged B-OP
the O
same B-OP
amount I-OP
as O
if O
we O
had O
our O
two O
double O
rooms B-AS
for O
the O
very B-OP
dilapidated I-OP
suite B-AS
. O

The O
terrain B-AS
park I-AS
is O
the O
best B-OP
I O
've O
been O
to O
( O
Limited O
to O
east O
coast O
) O
. O

You O
can O
never O
finish O
it O
with O
single O
dosa O
. O

Yeah O
, O
a O
little O
. O

THEN O
, O
now O
after O
8 O
days O
of O
staying O
there O
. O

The O
room B-AS
was O
very B-OP
clean I-OP
, O
neat B-OP
and O
comfortable B-OP
, O
especially O
the O
bed B-AS
. O

Same B-OP
quality B-AS
you O
would O
expect O
from O
Daniel O
minus O
the O
opulence B-AS
. O

This O
was O
my O
first B-OP
Bed B-AS
and O
Breakfast O
and O
Rick O
and O
Alla O
made O
it O
a O
wonderful B-OP
experience B-AS
. O

There O
were O
several B-OP
issues B-OP
with O
the O
room O
including O
NO B-OP
AIR B-AS
CONDITIONER I-AS
! O

The O
room B-AS
was O
lovely B-OP
and O
the O
spa B-AS
tub I-AS
was O
exquisite B-OP
- O
I O
particularly B-OP
appreciated I-OP
the O
bath B-AS
salts I-AS
that O
were O
provided O
! O

Time O
to O
go O
back O
to O
Borgata O
. O

I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
desk O
at O
least O
5 O
timed O
to O
get O
a O
new O
card O
and O
wait O
wait O

We O
arrived O
at O
the O
casino O
to O
enjoy B-OP
a O
few O
hours O
of O
cards B-AS
and O
one O
of O
our O
friends O
was O
asked O
to O
leave O
after O
only O
45 O
mins O
. O

we O
all O
around O
disliked B-OP
our O
stay B-AS

Never O
would O
have O
found O
it O
without O
my O
map O
. O

Overall O
this O
place B-AS
is O
a O
total B-OP
trap I-OP
and O
I O
advise O
that O
before O
anyone O
decides O
to O
stay O
with O
them O
that O
you O
think O
again O
, O
and O
then O
book O
a O
room O
at O
the O
Marriott O
instead O
. O

Their O
restaurant B-AS
was O
wonderful B-OP
and O
very B-OP
upscale I-OP
. O

I O
figured O
a O
review O
was O
necessary O
at O
this O
point O
: O
) O

The O
resort B-AS
was O
just O
like O
I O
remembered O
it O
from O
30 O
years O
ago O
- O
which O
I O
suppose O
could O
be O
a O
turn O
- O
off O
to O
someone O
hoping O
for O
a O
trendy B-OP
, O
upscale B-OP
place B-AS
. O

but O
they O
gave O
us O
smoker B-AS
rooms I-AS
without O
telling O
us O
before O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
find O
real O
meaning O
of O
Crispy O
hotel O
dosa O
, O
then O
you O
must O
visit O
vidyarthi O
bhavan O
once O
in O
a O
life O
time O
. O

What O
a O
great B-OP
resort B-AS
, O
we O
enjoyed B-OP
for O
5 O
nights O
. O

Hotel B-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

The O
staff B-AS
are O
friendly B-OP
- O
ish O
, O
like O
I O
've O
been O
invited O
to O
a O
party O
but O
am O
not O
actually O
that O
welcome O
. O

Lovely B-OP
place B-AS
... O
amazing B-OP
music B-AS
shows I-AS
... O

and O
I O
could O
go O
on O
. O

Food B-AS
was O
just B-OP
blah I-OP
, O
I O
went O
for O
Brunch O

NO O
SON O
ALGO O
DE O
EL O
OTRO O
MUNDO O
, O
ES O
UN O
HOTEL O
QUE O
ABARCA O
MUCHO O
TERRENO O
Y O
ES O
UN O
POCO O
INCOMODO O
, O
LOS O
ESTACIONAMIENTOS O
ESTÁN O
RETIRADOS O
DE O
LA O
HABITACIONES O
, O
ESO O
SI O
ESTÁN O
MUY O
BIEN O
VIGILADOS O
, O
LA O
COMIDA O
ES O
BASTANTE O
BUENA O
Y O

and O
it O
was O
great B-OP
to O
hear O
from O
the O
chef B-AS
and O
kitchen B-AS
staff I-AS
. O

Very B-OP
good I-OP
place B-AS
for O
a O
nice B-OP
dinner B-AS
on I-AS
the I-AS
ocean I-AS
! O
! O

Very B-OP
friendly I-OP
& O
clean B-OP
, O
always B-OP
enjoyable I-OP

Years O
ago O
I O
stayed O
at O
the O
Royal O
York O
hotel O
. O

LOS O
PAQUETES O
CON O
TODO O
INCLUIDO O
SON O
MUY O
ATRACTIVOS O
PERO O
AL O
HOTEL O
LE O
FALTA O
MUCHO O
MANTENIMIENTO O
. O

A O
bit B-OP
stodgy I-OP
but O
nothing B-OP
to O
complain O
about O
. O

Before O
arrival O
they O
told O
us O
that O
the O
only O
catch O
with O
the O
promotion O
that O
they O
were O
running O
was O
a O
short B-OP
hour I-OP
long I-OP
tour B-AS
of O
the O
facilities B-AS
, O
after O
which O
we O
would O
receive O
our O
complimentary B-OP
tickets O
to O
Islands O
of O
Adventure O
and O
a O
dinner B-AS
show I-AS
at O
Arabian O
Nights O
. O

The O
Shark B-AS
Bites I-AS
and O
Fish B-AS
Sandwich I-AS
outside O
are O
the O
best B-OP
there O
is O
. O

Horrible B-OP
horrible I-OP
service B-AS
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
far O
for O
dinner O
on O
Monday O
night O
. O

The O
place B-AS
is O
a O
rooftop B-AS
bar I-AS
that O
turns O
into O
a O
disco B-AS
at O
night O
. O

It O
feels O
like O
we O
're O
in O
a O
DiSaronno O
ad O
! O

I O
recently O
stayed O
at O
the O
Vacation B-AS
Villages I-AS
on O
a O
promotion O
that O
they O
were O
running O
, O
with O
me O

Its O
our O
home B-AS
away O
from O
home O
. O

excellent B-OP
service B-AS
. O

came O
for O
a O
few O
weddings O
. O

But O
judging O
by O
the O
service B-AS
you O
get O
at O
the O
restaurant O
. O

I O
honestly O
ca O
n't O
see O
how O
I O
could O
have O
been O
treated O
better O
even O
if O
I O
had O
VIP O
Status O
! O
! O

We O
stayed O
at O
this O
resort B-AS
for O
a O
week O
, O
and O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
worst B-OP
traveling B-AS
experiences I-AS
I O
have O
had O
. O

This O
is O
a O
terrible B-OP
hotel B-AS
. O

Do O
n't O
expect O
Westin B-AS
- O
level O
service B-AS
. O

As O
the O
tour O
continued O
they O
showed O
us O
demo O
models O
of O
the O
rooms O
we O
could O
have O

Revenge O
of O
the O
Mummy O
( O
an O
indoor B-AS
roller I-AS
coaster I-AS
that O
was O
actually O
kind O
of O
scary O
) O

but O
I O
did O
not O
have O
the O
nightmare B-OP
experience O
other O
people O
are O
reporting O
. O

the O
staff B-AS
were O
so B-OP
helpfull I-OP
. O

Rooms B-AS
are O
small B-OP
but O
that O
's O
expected B-OP
in O
a O
renovated B-OP
old I-OP
hotel B-AS
. O

they O
wo O
n't O
let O
you O
in O
unless O
there O
is O
a O
seat O
for O
you O
. O

Drinks B-AS
were O
fantastic B-OP
! O

If O

you O
can O
get O
the O
lunch B-AS

FOR O
MY O
HONEYMOON O

Holes B-OP
in O

from O
water B-AS
leaking I-AS
from O
room O
above O
. O

you O
probably O
wo O
n't O
feel O
cool O
enough O
to O
hang O
out O
here O
, O
but O
it O
's O
fun O
to O
pretend O
. O

The O
room B-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
and O
the O
staff B-AS
could O
n't O
have O
been O
more O
friendly O
and O
attentive B-OP
. O

We O
scheduled O
our O
walk O
- O
through O
for O
the O
facilities O
a O
day O
after O
we O
arrived O
at O
8:30 O
a. O
m. O
assuming O
that O
we O
could O
get O
the O
tour B-AS
out O
of O
the O
way O
early O
and O
get O
a O
great B-OP
jump B-AS
on O
the O
day O
. O

Very B-OP
Nice I-OP
Hotel B-AS
! O

Not B-OP
a I-OP
bad I-OP
hotel B-AS
for O
the O
price O
. O

it O
was O
a O
warm B-OP
welcoming I-OP
greeting B-AS
as O
if O
we O
were O
family O
. O

This O
place B-AS
was O
awesome B-OP
for O
our O
daughters O
, O
aged O
4 O
and O
nearly O
6 O
years O
old O
. O

Their O
is O
a O
cute B-OP
pizza B-AS
place I-AS
just O
next O
door O
. O

We O
paid B-OP
378 B-OP
dollars I-OP
for O
the O
room B-AS
for O
the O
night O
( O
including O
breakfast B-AS
) O
, O
which O
is O
on O
a O
par O
with O
the O
price O
you O
might O
pay O
for O
an O
extremely B-OP
nice I-OP
hotel B-AS
in O
New O
York O
or O
Miami O
. O

Love B-OP
the O
beer B-AS
selection I-AS
here O

Plus O
, O
the O
chocolate B-AS
chip I-AS
cookies I-AS
and O
house B-AS
wine I-AS
in O
the O
afternoon O
just O
simply O
could O
not O
be O
beat O
! O

We O
ended O
up O
leaving O
the O
next O
day O
for O
a O
hostel B-AS
on O
the O
Upper O
West O
Side O
-- O
which O
was O
far B-OP
cleaner I-OP
and O
just O
about O
the O
same O
price O
. O

( O
CitW O
was O
the O
best O
) O
, O
and O
could O
've O
seen O
more O
if O
we O
had O
n't O
gone O
to O
the O
Bill O
& O
Ted O
show O
( O
which O
ended O
up O
being O
entertaining B-OP
enough O
but O
kind O
of O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
) O
. O

Sound O
of O
music B-AS
from O
nearby O
venues O
thumped B-OP
into O
room O
all O
night O
. O

Rouge B-AS
Tomate I-AS
is O
a O
rather B-OP
interesting I-OP
dining B-AS
experience I-AS
. O

Yet O
, O
I O
felt O
that O
if O
they O
were O
trying O
to O
sell O
us O
on O
this O
place O
, O
they O
would O
have O
put O
us O
in O
a O
room O
with O
all O
of O
these O
amenities B-AS
, O
opposed O
to O
an O
older B-OP
dilapidated I-OP
version O
. O

ALL O
THE O
FURNITURE B-AS
LOOKED B-OP
ANCIENT I-OP
. O

From O
the O
time O
I O
walked O
in O
with O
my O
service B-AS
animal O
I O
was O
treated B-OP
like B-OP
royalty B-AS
. O

Two O
business B-AS
entities I-AS
passing O
the O
buck O
, O
and O
it O
lands O
on O
me O
. O

It O
is O
simply B-OP
old I-OP
and O
charming B-OP
, O
with O
more B-OP
character B-AS
than O
the O
plastic O
hotels O
they O
're O
putting O
up O
these O
days O
. O

Suite B-AS
was O
massive B-OP
. O

Great B-OP
service B-AS
. I-AS

But O
they O
do O
charge B-AS
an O
extra B-OP
$ I-OP
10 I-OP
per I-OP
night I-OP
resort O
fee O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
night O
I O
had O
to O
beg O
her O
to O
come O
back O
and O
stay O
at O
my O
place O
. O

All O
round O
the O
worst B-OP
hotel B-AS
ever I-AS
. O

after O
you O
leave O
you O
loose O
your O
points O
. O

once O
one O
gets O
close O
enough O
to O
you O
it O
'll O
jump O
and O
snarl O
without O
warning O
. O

if O
you O
're O
okay O
getting O
soaked O
) O

The O
food B-AS
was O
decent B-OP
, O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
great B-OP
and O
the O
activities B-AS
were O
varied B-OP
and O
fun B-OP
for O
all O
ages O
. O

I O
even O
ended O
up O
in O
urgent B-OP
care O
and O
many O
had O
to O
leave O
the O
convention O
early O
. O

We O
walked O
back O
into O
the O
hotel O
, O
to O
use O
the O
toilet O
, O
through O
the O
main O
foyer O
and O
were O
asked O
by O
a O
member O
ofparrot O
head O
security O
if O
we O
had O
a O
' O
pass O
' O
? O

They O
said O
they O
would O
fix O
it O
while O
we O
were O
out O
, O
but O
they O
did O
n't O
. O

pontins O
a O
holiday B-AS
park I-AS
witch I-AS
is O
fun B-OP
for O
the O
whole O
family O
. O

The O
food B-AS
on O
offer O
was O
fine B-OP
and O
good B-OP
value I-OP
for O
money O
. O

Also O
, O
if O
you O
're O
a O
fan O
of O

low B-OP

The O

have O
mostly O
been O
re O
- O
done O
very B-OP
nicely I-OP
, O
some O
even O
with O
jacuzzi B-AS
jet I-AS
tubs I-AS
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
nice O
job O
trying O
to O
make O
your O
piece O
of O
crap O
hotel B-AS
look O
good O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
have O
felt O
more O
special O

That O
is O
where O
they O
serve O
the O
top B-OP
- I-OP
shelf I-OP
liquor B-AS
and O
all O
of O
the O
good B-OP
stuff B-AS
-- O
there O
really O
is O
a O
difference O
between O
the O
regular O
hotel B-AS
, O
royalty O
service O
and O
the O
Reserve O
-- O
spend O
the O
extra B-OP
$ I-OP
100ish I-OP
and O
stay O
at O
the O
Reserve O
. O

We O
enjoyed B-OP
the O
Driftwood B-AS
room I-AS
for O
happy O
hour O
. O

a O
bit O
more O
fixing O
and O
less O
posing O
would O
turn O
the O
place O
around O
. O

Go O
elsewhere O
. O

While O
everyone O
was O
waiting B-AS
40 B-OP
minutes I-OP
or O
so O
to O
get O
into O
the O
Bongo O
Room O
, O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
were O
getting O
our O
bottomless B-OP
mimosas B-AS
refilled I-AS
. O

I O
will O
be O
sure O
to O
go O
here O
if O
I O
ever O
make O
it O
out O

began O
2 O
months O
prior O
to O
our O
arrival O
. O

Staff B-AS
was O
friendly B-OP
. O

I O
love B-OP
their O
services B-AS
. O

However O
, O
I O
would O
not O
consider O
the O
attractions B-AS
or O
amenities B-AS
in O
Key O
West O
anywhere O
near O
in O
comparison O
with O
either O
city O

Best B-OP
trip B-AS
ever O

I O
have O
stayed O
in O
Niagara O
Falls O
plenty O
of O
times O
and O
this O
hotel B-AS
is O
the O
best B-OP
of O
them O
all O
. O

and O
I O
stayed O
at O
The O
Gaslight O
for O
3 O
nights O
. O

Hidden O
by O
a O
graffiti B-OP
- I-OP
clad I-OP
boarded I-OP
up I-OP
storefront B-AS
, O
this O
speak O
- O
easy O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
spots B-AS
to O
get O
a O
drink O
on O
a O
date O
night O
. O

but O
yet O
not O
know O
his O
name O
. O

but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
was O
pleasantly B-OP
surprised I-OP
. O

I O
decided O
to O
splurge O
for O
our O
anniversary O
and O
reserve O
a O
presidential B-AS
suite I-AS
with O
a O
view O
of O
the O
falls O
, O
it O
was O
definately B-OP
worth I-OP
the O
money B-AS
. O

but O
our O
stay B-AS
was O
wonderful B-OP
. O

They O
have O
a O
fenced B-OP
in I-OP
wading B-AS
pool I-AS
for O
toddlers O
and O
children O
who O
ca O
n't O
swim O
; O
this O
was O
a O
big B-OP
plus I-OP
. O

NEVER O
GOT O
BELOW O
75 O
DEGREES O
EVEN O
ON O
THE O
COLDEST O
SETTING O
. O

Really B-OP
neat I-OP
place B-AS
with O
some B-OP

and O
good B-OP
location B-AS
. O

teeny O

so B-OP
perfect I-OP
for O

nights I-AS

The O
experience B-AS
was O
amazing B-OP
. O

This O
instantly O
made O
us O
somewhat B-OP
surprised I-OP
and O
outraged O
. O

TO O
STAY O
FOR O
3 O
MINUTES O
AND O
SAY O
IT O
WAS O

we O
could O
n't O
wait O
to O

Harrahs O
/ O
Caesars O
properties O
for O
20 O
plus O
years O
under O
many O
names O
, O
getting O
much O
worse O
. O

The O
wood B-AS
was O
never B-OP
low I-OP
and O
water B-AS
was O
very B-OP
hot I-OP
which O
was O
very B-OP
welcome I-OP
. O

The O
staff B-AS
at O
the O

is O
truly B-OP
5-star I-OP
. O

I O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
again O
. O

Sarah O
was O
warm B-OP
, O
efficient B-OP
and O
made O
great B-OP
coffees B-AS
. O

Oh O
yes O
the O
Hotel B-AS
is O
small B-OP
, O
quiet B-OP
and O
a O
good B-OP
value B-AS
. O

If O
you O
are O
charging O
prime B-OP
rates I-OP
for O
parking B-AS
, O
the O
service O
needs O
to O
be O
there O
as O
well O
. O

Overall O
comps B-AS
with O
Caesars O
entertainment O
declined B-OP
, O
fewer O
and O
not O
as O
good O
as O
past O
. O

we O
usually O
stay O
at O
the O
wilderness O
but O
wanted O
to O
try O
something O
new O
and O
we O
regret O
it O

A O
terrific B-OP
location B-AS
, O
so B-OP
central I-OP
. O

I O
had O
to O
use O
my O
debit O
card O
for O
an O
incidental O
fee O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-AS
at O
this O
place O
is O
straight B-OP
out I-OP
of I-OP
mad I-OP
scientists I-OP
steam I-OP
punk I-OP
fantasy I-OP
. O

The O
walls B-AS
are O
thin B-OP
and O
I O
could O
hear O
a O
dog B-AS
barking B-OP
in O
the O
room O
across O
from O
mine O
( O
thankfully O
it O
only O
barked O
when O
it O
heard O
people O
walk O
in O
the O
hallway O
-- O
it O
did O
not O
bother O
me O
at O
night O
) O
. O

We O
called O
at O
8:15 O
AM O
and O
got O
permission O
for O
extended B-OP
checkout B-AS
, O
front O
desk O
called O
at O
11:15 O
and O
rudly O
told O
us O
someone O
had O
turned O
in O
room O
keys O
( O
no O
one O
had O
) O
and O
that O
we O
were O
trespassing O
and O
they O
could O
call O
the O
police O
if O
we O
did O
n't O
leave O
immediatly O
. O
. O

I O
was O
then O
redirected O
a O
few O
times O
until O
I O
finally O
got O
in O
touch O
with O
the O
right O
person O
. O

All O
Vegas O

pump B-OP
in O
their O
custom B-OP
fragrance O
and O
at O
Caesar O

this O
is O
especially B-OP
strong I-OP
and O
especially B-OP
offensive I-OP
. O

Not O
a O

by O
the O

And O
if O
you O
are O
hungry O
and O
its O
late O
... O
you O
can O
just O
go O
hungry O
. O

We O
still O
there O
for O
one O
night O
me O
and O
my O
husband O

when O
I O
complained O
at O
the O
front O
desk O
, O
the O
bellman O
found O
a O
public O
cart O
and O
proceeded O
to O
throw O
it O
at O

This O
is O
just O
bad B-OP
business B-AS
, O
considering O
it O
's O
a O
casino B-AS
and O
he O
needs O
to O
find O
a O
way O
not O
to O
discriminate O
between O

Friendly B-OP

The O

well B-OP
maintained I-OP

The O
2nd O

was O
not B-OP
much I-OP
better I-OP

WiFi B-AS

Scene O

Food B-AS

Every O

bit B-OP
sad O
, O
although O
staff O
explained O
me O
that O
i O
also O
was O
on O
the O
only O
room O
with O
kitchen O
... O

and O
overall O
I O
would O
have O
much O
preferred O
going O
somewhere O
else O
like O
Cracker O
Barrel O
over O
this O
. O

They O
gave O
us O
two O
rooms B-AS
on O
one O
floor O
and O
the O
other O
two O
on O
seperate O
floors O
. O

However O
you O
need O
to O
wait O
really B-OP
long I-OP
long I-OP
time O
to O
get O
your O
seat O
( O
especially O
on O
peak O
hours O
) O
, O
you O
need O
to O
share O
your O
table O
with O
other O
strangers O
( O
that O
's O
the O
real O
maja O
of O
traditional O
hotels O
) O
, O
even O
after O
getting O
table O
you O
must O
wait O
long O
for O
your O
Dosa O
to O
arrive O

My O
stay B-AS
their O
was O
amazing B-OP
. O

I O
had O
a O
cold O
, O
and O
missed O
a O
regular B-OP
tissue B-AS
dispenser I-AS
that O
you O
see O
in O
most O
other O
hotel O
rooms O
( O
Instead O
, O
you O
guests O
are O
just O
given O
a O
mini O

pack O
of O
tissues O

I O
definitely B-OP
recommend I-OP
staying O
at O
Lollis O
. O

This O

some B-OP

, O
like O

My O
BF O
and O
I O
went O
here O
mainly O
for O
The O
Wizarding B-AS
World I-AS
of O
Harry O
Potter O
( O
which O
was O
freaking B-OP
awesome I-OP
) O
, O
but O
had O
a O
blast B-OP
at O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
park B-AS
as O
well O
. O

An O
excelent B-OP
choice B-AS
! O

My O
girlfriend O
almost O
refused O
to O
stay O
there O
. O

Very B-OP
family B-AS
friendly O
! O

The O
first O
room B-AS
I O
was O
placed O
in O
smelled B-OP
heavily I-OP
of I-OP
mold I-OP
and I-OP
mildew I-OP
. O

We O
all O
thought O
more O
people O
should O
know O
about O
it O

They O
also O
have O
a O
good B-OP
selection I-OP
of O
house B-AS
specialties I-AS
, O
so O
be O
sure O
to O
give O
those O
a O
try O
. O

I O
go O
to O
blow O
my O
nose O
, O
1-tissue O
in O
the O
container O
, O
small B-OP
issue I-OP
but O
things O
just O
keep O
adding O
up O
. O

On O
- O
premise O
restaurants B-AS
are O
outrageously B-OP
expensive I-OP
, O
but O
I O
think O
Vegas O
as O
a O
whole O
is O
going O
that O
way O
. O

Everyone B-AS
very B-OP
helpful I-OP
. O

Mosaic B-AS
Restaurant I-AS
is O
such O
a O
amazing O
place B-AS
. O

We O
had O
to O
hunt O
down O
a O
waitress O
for O
ever O
order O
, O
and O
when O
we O
finally O
found O
a O
waitress O
they O
never B-OP
smiled O
, O
like O
they O
hated B-OP
there O
job O
, O
even O
when O
we O
tipped O
them O
they O
where O
very B-OP
un I-OP
- I-OP
friendly I-OP
. O

but O
i O
had O
drinks O
at O
a O
bar O
just O
outside O
of O
it O
and O
watched O
a O
shitload B-OP
of O
women O
enter O
it O
. O

they O
had O
an O
awesome B-OP
live I-OP

The O
Stanley B-AS
is O
a O
very B-OP
old I-OP
, O
very B-OP
historic I-OP
building B-AS
, O
and O
the O
owners O
have O
worked O
hard O
to O
keep O
it O
that O
way O
. O

Yes O
, O
there O
are O
several B-OP
bumps B-AS
in O
the O
night O
and O
strange B-OP
noises B-AS
, O
but O
that O
's O
what O
draws O
me O
to O
it O
. O

such O
a O
great B-OP
, O
unique B-OP
setting B-AS
! O

We O
had O
plenty B-OP
of O
space B-AS
for O
seven O
family O
members O
to O
congregate O
( O
not O
sharing O
the O
room O
, O
lol O
) O
and O
the O
cross B-AS
ventilation I-AS
with O
windows O
facing O
two O
ways O
in O
our O
corner O
room O
made O
it O
just B-OP
perfect I-OP
. O

Very B-OP
small I-OP
indoor B-AS
water I-AS
park I-AS
, O
beds B-AS
suck B-OP
, O
loud B-OP
, O
and O
boring B-OP

it O
's O
obvious O
my O
front O
bumper O
rubbed O
against O
the O
wall O
in O
their O
garage O
, O
did O
n't O
notice O
until O
I O
got O
home O
and O
washed O
my O
car O
. O

Near O
the O
hotel O
there O
are O
also O
two O
underground B-AS
stations I-AS
. O

The O
accessible B-OP
room B-AS
was O
really B-OP
accessible I-OP
. O

Oh O
and O
to O
go O
along O
woth O
health B-AS
issues O
there O
was O
blood O
splattered O
on O
the O

Plenty B-OP
warm I-OP

comfortable I-OP

Did O

I O
had O
been O
to O
Seven O
Springs O
as O
a O
kid O
and O
was O
excited B-OP
to O
go O
back O
- O
until O
I O
read O
some O
reviews O
about O
the O
service B-AS
. O

Booked B-OP
nonsmoking B-OP

Great B-OP
people B-AS

After O
having O
driven O
5 O
hours O
from O
Miami O
to O
get O
to O
Key O
West O
, O
we O
were O
tired B-OP
and O
were O
looking O
forward O
to O
chilling O
out O
by O
the O
pool O
, O
in O
a O
luxury B-OP
hotel B-AS
( O
one O
of O
the O
most O
, O
if O
not O
the O
most O
, O
expensive B-OP
hotels B-AS
in O
Key O
West O
) O
. O

Parking B-AS
is O
acceptable B-OP
and O
the O
shuttle B-AS
service I-AS
is O
frequent B-OP
. O

The O
coffee B-AS
next O
door O
is O
excellent B-OP
with O
friendly B-OP
baristas B-AS
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
in O
our O
room O
, O
overall O
everything B-AS
was O
acceptable B-OP
, O
yet O
the O
couch B-AS
was O
flimsy B-OP
and O
uncomfortable B-OP
, O
the O
T. B-AS
V. I-AS
was O
very B-OP
outdated I-OP
and O
had O
buttons B-AS
missing B-OP
, O
and O
instead O
of O
a O
DVD O
player O
it O
had O
a O
VCR O
. O

Once O
I O
ran O
over O
Mickey O
Rooney O
, O
but O
that O
is O
a O
story O
for O
another O
time O
, O
when O
I O
review O
Mickey O
Rooney O
. O

Rude B-OP
, O
arrogant B-OP
, O
trashy B-OP
people B-AS
run O
this O
place B-AS
. O

Today O
, O
we O
wanted O
to O
ski O
for O
a O
while O
before O
leaving O
so O

A O
glass B-AS
- O
fence O
would O
be O
much O
better O
to O
let O
you O
see O
more O
of O
midtown O
, O
and O
to O
protect O
better O
against O
the O
wind O
. O

This O
is O
a O
top B-OP
of I-OP
the I-OP
line I-OP
casino B-AS
! O

Go O
around O
the O
corner O
to O
Lincoln O
Park O
Bar O
& O
Grill O
. O

The O
service B-AS
has O
overall O
has O
gone B-OP
downhill I-OP
at O
this O
resort B-AS
hotel I-AS
. O

We O
work O
hard O
for O
our O
money B-AS
, O
and O
I O
would O
happily O
spend O
it O
at O
this O
hotel O
again O
and O
again O
. O

We O
went O
toward O
the O
end O
of O
September O
so O
it O
was O
n't B-OP
crowded I-OP
at O
all O

Ca B-OP
n't I-OP
fault I-OP
the O
service B-AS
here O
. O

The O
trademark O
being O
the O
red B-OP
robes B-AS
provided O
to O
protect O
you O
from O
the O
strong B-OP
wind B-AS
blowing O
on O
the O
terrace O
. O

They O
only O
thing O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
buffet B-AS
restaurant I-AS
was O
VERY B-OP
UNDER I-OP
STAFFED I-OP
! O
! O
! O
! O

The O
rooms B-AS
are O
a O
little B-OP
dated I-OP
but O
very B-OP
well I-OP
maintained I-OP
and O
clean B-OP
. O

I O
was O
at O
computer O
a O
few O
times O
and O
witnessed O
most O
of O
the O
inappropriate B-OP
conduct B-AS
. O

I O
've O
been O
there O
twice O
in O
four O
months O
, O
and O
will O
probably O
be O

again O
before O

year O
is O
over O

Free B-OP
shuttle B-AS

Very B-OP
cold I-OP

weekend O

The O
parking B-AS
is O
very B-OP
convenient I-OP
too O
. O

Whatever O
the O
ambiance B-AS
is O
good B-OP
but O
who O
cares O
when O
your O
night B-AS
is O
ruined B-OP
by O
the O
staff O
. O

The O
kind B-OP
demeanor B-AS
and O
level B-OP
of O
professionalism B-AS
of O
the O
management B-AS
and O
staff B-AS
are O
unrivaled B-OP
by O
any O
hotel O
I O
've O
done O
business O
with O
in O
the O
past O
. O

When O
we O
first O
checked O
in O

we O
asked O
for O
four O
rooms O
next O
to O
each O
other O
. O

Cabins B-AS
are O
small B-OP
but O
cosy B-OP
. O

This O
is O
a O
great B-OP
place B-AS
to O
check O
out O
and O
the O
tour B-AS
's O
are O
worth B-OP
taking O
. O

We O
are O
going O
back O
with O
our O
families O
next O
! O

Full B-OP

as O
a O
1 O
because O
the O
hosts B-AS
were O
kind O
of O
talking O
to O
one O
another O
as O
I O
stood O
there O
waiting O
for O
their O
attention O
and O
the O
one O
host O
was O
a O
little B-OP
short I-OP
with O
me O
. O

We O
felt O
like O
we O
were O
getting O
VIP B-OP
treatment B-AS
from O
an O
expensive B-OP
resort B-AS
chain I-AS
, O
but O
twith O
he O
Mom&Pop B-AS
atmosphere I-AS
. O

It O
has O
a O
very B-OP
Olde I-OP
English I-OP
feel B-AS
, O
but O
sadly O
does O
n't O
have O
the O
built O
in O
ghost O
( O
story O
) O
that O
would O
accompany O
this O
place O
in O
the O
UK O
! O

Also O
, O
it O
takes O
forever O
to O
get O
a O
table B-AS
service I-AS
. O

After O
talking O
to O
the O
manager O
he O
admitted O
that O
they O
were O
wrong O
but O
said O
they O
were O
still O
not O
allowing O
us O
back O
in O
. O

Great B-OP
services B-AS
, O
restaurants B-AS
, O
pools B-AS
and O
beach B-AS
area I-AS
. O

I O
'll O
be O
finding O
a O
new O
place B-AS
to O
stay O
. O

I O
had O
a O
horrible B-OP
night B-AS
and O
slept O
on O
their O
mini O
couch O
instead O
to O
prevent O
more O
bites O
. O

Staff B-AS
was O
tremendous B-OP
. O

Only O
complain O
is O
that O
it O
is O
quite B-OP
a I-OP
walk B-AS
from O
the O
bellagio O
and O
caesar O
's O
palace O
. O

I O
was O
at O
this O
hotel O
with O
a O
large B-OP
group B-AS
of I-AS
people I-AS
who O
all O
seemed O
to O
bombard O
the O
bar O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

We O
had O
just O
spent O
shy O
of O
400 O
dollars O
and O
were O
not O
allowed O
back O
in O
the O
hotel O
. O

The O
rest O
had O
great B-OP
staff B-AS
, O
but O
their O
paella B-AS
was O
probably O
the O
worst B-OP
I O
've O
ever O
had O
tasted O
like O
it O
was O
made O
out O
of O
a O
box O
, O
I O
tried O
to O
give O
them O
another O
chance O
, O
but O
the O
Chicken B-AS
Rancheros I-AS
was O
no B-OP
better I-OP
either O
. O

Food B-AS
at O
the O
bar B-AS
was O
reasonable B-OP
and O
did O
n't O
have O
any O
problems O
. O

They O
do O
not B-OP
care I-OP
about O
their O
guests B-AS
and O
can O
care O
less O
if O
you O
find O
bed B-AS
bugs I-AS
. O

good B-OP
music B-AS
venue I-AS
. O

Service B-AS
: O
Extremely B-OP
courteous I-OP

Our O
reservations B-AS

a O
surprise O
when O
we O

told O

no B-OP
double B-AS

Vada O

kesari O
bath O
to O
pass O
the O

more O
for O
the O
price O

if O
you O

! O

Rooms B-AS

really B-OP
clean I-OP
. O

Lets O

about O

and O
the O
food B-AS
was O
delicious B-OP
. O

Twas O
off O
the O

to O
be O
sure O
. O

Thank O
you O
all O
wonderful B-OP
people B-AS
working O
at O
ONE O
UN O
New O
York O
. O

but O
i O
did O
n't O
asked O
for O
that O
, O
and O
i O
reserved O
it O
mostly O
because O
of O
the O
lights B-AS
( O
travelling O
only O
with O
my O
wife O
) O
. O

When O
we O
went O
to O
the O
desk O
to O
complain O
all O
the O
management B-AS
and O
the O
person O
that O
called O
were O
busy B-OP
. O

This O
is O
a O
true B-OP
boutique B-AS
and O
a O
great B-OP
value B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
also O
treated O
my O
service B-AS
animal I-AS
terrific B-OP
. O

Wish O
the O
TV B-AS
was O
updated B-OP
though O
- O
too B-OP
small I-OP
and O
old B-OP
. O

TALKED O
ME O
INTO O
UPGRADING O
TO O
A O
SUITE B-AS
ON O
THE O
TOP O
FLOOR O
IN O
THE O
EAST O
TOWER O
. O

If O
was O
very B-OP
annoying I-OP
and O
very B-OP
distracting I-OP
and O
VERY B-OP
unprofessional I-OP
considering O
the O
amount O
of O
money O
paid O
to O
go O
to O
this O
conference O
. O

Progressively O
better O
, O
faster B-OP
service B-AS
each O
time O
. O

When O
a O
leak B-AS
began O
from O
the O
bathroom O
ceiling O
, O
staff O
sent O
someone O
right O
over O
and O
relocated O
us O
to O
another O
room O
. O

Unpleasant B-OP
staff B-AS
. O

firstly O
the O
location B-AS
is O
nice B-OP
. O

Fanciest B-OP
casino B-AS
in O
Vegas O
. O

new B-OP
friends B-AS

We O
went O
skiing O
, O
snow O

, O
live B-OP
music B-AS
can O
be O
great B-OP
, O
in O
the O
right B-OP
setting B-AS
and O
context B-AS
. O

Let O
me O
just O
say O
, O
if O
the O
room B-AS
was O
over B-OP
$ I-OP
200 I-OP
, O
chances O
are O
I O
would O
have O
been O
disappointed O
. O

Uncooked B-OP
food B-AS
on O
multiple O
occasions O

Everybody B-AS
is O
nice B-OP
and O
welcoming B-OP
. O

One O
day O
is O
not O
nearly O
enough O
time O
to O
hit O
everything O
in O
one O
park O
, O
let O
alone O
all O
of O
them O
. O

On O
our O
first O
visit O
, O
we O
stayed O
at O
Pinnacles B-AS
Resort I-AS
for O
a O
week O
in O
June O
2010 O
. O

Mix B-OP
of O
suits B-AS
, O
locals B-AS
, O
and O
retirees B-AS

Highly B-OP
appreciated I-OP
the O
staying B-AS
and O
recommend B-OP
a O
great B-OP
job B-AS
. O

And O
the O
view B-AS
... O
of O
course O
, O
the O
view O
... O
it O
truly O
does O
n't O
get O
any O
better O
! O

I O
love B-OP
an O
exciting B-OP
mixed B-AS
drink I-AS
but O
this O
place B-AS
just O
falls B-OP
into I-OP
the I-OP
speakeasy I-OP
trend I-OP
it O
seems O
. O

Very B-OP
nice I-OP
hotel B-AS
! O

Very B-OP
disappointing I-OP
$ B-AS
100 I-AS
for O
with O
fi O
? O

I O
would O
definitely O
stay O
again O
! O

this O
time O
I O
found O
BED B-AS
BUGS I-AS
on O
my O
bed O
. O

The O
worst B-OP
place B-AS
ever O
... O

Bed B-AS
was O
too B-OP
soft I-OP
. O

and O
then O
I O
had O
bed B-AS
bug I-AS
bites I-AS
prior O
to O
leaving O
. O

No B-OP
disappointment B-AS
when O
it O
comes O
to O
libations B-AS
here O
. O

I O
know O
that O
some O
people O
near O
to O
us O
complained O
about O
damp B-OP
accommodation B-AS
and O
had O
to O
be O
relocated O

Great B-OP
location B-AS
.. O

The O
hotel B-AS
is O
gorgeous B-OP
and O
the O
staff B-AS
is O
top B-OP
notch I-OP
. O

and O
I O
was O
traveling O
with O
a O
pregnant B-OP
wife O
. O

It O
's O
worth O
spending O
a O
few O
dollars O
more O
for O
a O
suite B-AS
or O
suite O
- O
like O
room B-AS
. O

Where O
else O
can O
you O
be O
surrounded O
by O
shelves B-OP
of O
records B-AS
and O
comfy B-OP
seats B-AS
? O

When O
we O
came O
back O
there O
were O
literally B-OP
hundreds I-OP
of I-OP
people B-AS
milling O
around O
the O
front O
of O
the O
hotel O
. O

The O
bar B-AS
has O
a O
piano B-AS
player I-AS
which O
is O
casual B-OP
and O
fun B-OP
. O

Beautiful B-OP
hotel B-AS
. O

The O
speakers B-AS
on O
my O
TV O
were O
blown B-OP
. O

So O
can O
I O
say O
, O
never O
again O
. O

I O
would O
never O
come O
back O
here O
. O

The O
internet B-AS
did O
n't B-OP
work I-OP
very I-OP
well I-OP
, O
so O
I O
spent O
40 O
minutes O
talking O
to O
someone O
not O
at O
the O
hotel O
while O
she O
tried O
various O
things O
that O
did O
n't O
work O
. O

One O
of O
my O
absolute B-OP
favorites B-AS
in O
SLO O
. O

However O
, O
the O
problems B-AS
we O
experienced O
were O
not B-OP
worth I-OP
the O
price O
. O

the O
main O
thing O
i O
liked B-OP
is O
the O
breakfast B-AS
, O
really B-OP
good I-OP
, O
very B-OP
nice I-OP
spread B-AS
. O

If O
you O
want O
a O
decent B-OP
place B-AS
to O
stay O
for O
cheap O
and O
do O
n't O
expect O
amazing O
, O
come O
here O
. O

We O
were O
offered O
double O
rooms O
for O
the O
2nd O
night O
but O
when O
we O
went O
to O
get O
the O
room O
keys O
, O
we O
were O
told O
again O
there O
were O
no B-OP
rooms B-AS
. O

Had O
to O
go O
an O
extra O
step O
to O
avoid O
getting O
charges O
for O
things O
we O
did O
nt O
use O
. O

Just O
going O
to O
the O
casino O
, O
getting O
some O
coffee O
and O
going O
back O
up O
to O
the O
room O
I O
think O
is O
1 O
mile O
. O

I O
understand O
cutting O
back O
some O
perks O
but O
not O
the O
way O
they O
are O
doing O
it O
, O
too O
much O
too O
fast O
. O

i O
will O
come O
back O

Great B-OP
views B-AS
, O
rooms B-AS
and O
location B-AS
. O

The O
people B-AS
were O
respectful B-OP
. O

Very B-OP
nice I-OP
people B-AS
. O

I O
give O
the O
location B-AS
and O
cleansiness B-AS
a O
plus B-OP
. O

Is O
it O
a O
good B-OP
deal B-AS
for O
the O
price B-AS
? O

My O
main O
complaint B-OP
is O
the O
* O
smell B-AS
* O
of O
the O
place B-AS
. O

NO O
SON O
MEZQUINOS O
, O
LAS O
BEBIDAS O
CERBESA O
POLAR O
DE O
CIFON O
LE O
FALTA O
FRIÓ O
, O
Y O
LOS O
COK O

Diamond O
Member O
and O
I O
can O
not O
even O
get O
a O
room O
upgrade O
. O

Their O
drinks B-AS
are O
really B-OP
tasty I-OP
but O
a O
bit B-OP
on I-OP
the I-OP
weak I-OP
side I-OP
. O

The O
hotel B-AS
was O
alright B-OP
. O

Check O
it O
out O
if O
you O
want O
a O
unique B-OP
vacation B-AS
in O
Chicago O
. O

I O
may O
not O
win O
when O
i O
come O
here O
a O
lot O

I O
advised O
a O
spring O
break O
trip O
here O
with O
a O
group O
of O
students O
and O
at O
least O
half O
of O
our O
rooms B-AS
were O
infested B-OP
with O
bed B-AS
bugs I-AS
. O

Next O
time O
going O
to O
Palazzo O
again O
. O

i O
'll O
never O
stay O
at O
embassy O
suites O
again O
. O

Overall O
, O
while O
coming O
out O
you O
will O
be O
satisfied B-OP
and O
glad B-OP
for O
your O
sacrifices B-AS
. O

Moreover O
, O
we O
moved O
to O
a O
hostel O
on O
the O
Upper O
West O
Side O
( O
only O
15 O
minutes O
from O
Midtown O
) O
that O
was O
the O
same O
price O
, O
clean O
, O
and O
safe O
. O

I O
FOUND O
A O
SYRINGE O
IN O
THE O
TOILET O
when O
I O
was O
a O
point O
to O
use O
the O
toilet O
, O
it O
touched O
my O
hand O
and O
now O
nobody O
is O
responsible O
in O
case O
of O
something O
happens O
to O
me O
. O

everything B-AS
is O
likable B-OP
and O
would O
definitely B-OP
recommend I-OP
for O
anyone O
who O
wants O
to O
stay O
near O
the O
main O
station O
in O
munich O
. O

These O
items O
should O
have O
been O
listed O
online O
with O
the O
price O
of O
the O
room O
. O

Although O
I O
give O
them O
a O
10/10 B-OP
on O
that O
famous B-OP
pulled O
pork O
sandwich O
. O

I O
understand O
that O
parking B-AS
fee I-AS
, O
but O
charge B-AS
was O
is O
posted B-OP
. O

I O
highly B-OP
recommend I-OP
the O
hotel B-AS
as O
a O
great B-OP
place B-AS
to O
stay O
but O
would O
advise O
you O
to O
make O
plans O
to O
eat O
dinner O
elswhere O
. O

There O
is O
simply O
no O
reason O
to O
compromise O
. O

Not O
so O
much O
, O
to O
be O
honest O
. O

The O
phones B-AS
did O
n't B-OP
work I-OP
, O
and O
after O
we O
complained O
, O
they O
fought O
with O
us O
and O
only O
offered O
to O
comp O
$ O
30 O
on O
a O
$ O
144/night O
room O
. O

so O
we O
ended O
up O
not O
staying O
, O
but O
if O
you O
're O
on O
a O
serious O
budget B-AS
, O
its O
OK O
. O

Rooms B-AS
very B-OP
spacious I-OP
. O

it O
's O
a O
nice B-OP
quiet I-OP
place B-AS
and O
they O
have O
a O
great B-OP
customer B-AS
service I-AS
and O
a O
friendly B-OP
its O
nice B-OP

, O
staff B-AS
was O
pleasant B-OP
, O
breakfast B-AS
was O
good B-OP
. O

may O
let O
the O
flavours B-AS
be O
tasted O
rather O
than O
numbing O
the O
tongue O
with O
the O
cold B-OP
temperature O
. O

An O
enjoyable B-OP
experience B-AS
every O
visit O
, O
would O
recommend O
to O
have O
treatment B-AS
at O
the O
spa B-AS
, O
amazing B-OP
products B-AS
and O
professional B-OP
staff B-AS
, O
the O
whole O
experience B-AS
was O
totally B-OP
relaxing I-OP

I O
would O
not O
bring O
children O
, O
but O
for O
an O
adult O
getaway O
this O
is O
perfect B-OP
. O

Decent B-OP
waits B-AS
but O
still O
kinda B-OP
long I-OP
at O
a O
few O
others O
. O

Staff B-AS
was O
friendly B-OP
and O
willing B-OP
to O
help O
in O
any O
way O
, O
room B-AS
was O
clean B-OP
and O
comfortable B-OP
, O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
beautiful B-OP
. O

but O
I O
prefer B-OP
modern B-OP
style B-AS

Way B-OP
too I-OP
many I-OP
inconveniences B-AS
for O
the O
price O
. O

Excellent B-OP
, O
roomy B-OP
& O
great B-OP
staff B-AS
:) O

I O
absolutely B-OP
loved I-OP
the O
place B-AS
at O
first O
, O
similar B-OP
look B-AS
and O
feel B-AS
of O
when O
you O
are O
in O
Vegas O
, O
but O
that O
comparison O
is O
no O
longer O
true O
, O
BY O
FAR O
. O

He O
fixed B-OP
the O
hot B-OP
water B-AS
issue I-AS
. O

After O
complaining O
to O
the O
supervisor O
about O
the O
health B-AS
issue I-AS
going O
on O
all O
he O
could O
say O
was O
ill O
pass O
it O
along O
are O
you O
kidding O
me O
? O
! O
! O

We O
called O
them O
about O
it O
and O
they O
never O
called O
back O
. O

who O
quite O
frankly O
should O
not O
be O
working O
in O
the O
service O
industry O
. O

We O
went O
to O
the O
Gaylord O
during O
October O
when O
they O
were O
doing O
the O
Shrek O
halloween O
event O
. O

Its O
a O
pub B-AS
what O
do O
you O
expect O
? O

Our O
rooms B-AS
were O
very B-OP
nice I-OP
and O
the O
conference B-AS
room I-AS
was O
great B-OP
. O

We O
went O
to O
see O
Balagan O
at O
the O
Beau B-AS
Rivage I-AS
and O
were O
truly B-OP
disappointed I-OP
. O

The O
hotel B-AS
is O
better B-OP
- I-OP
located I-OP
impossible I-OP
. O

Did O
n't O
go O
into O
club O
LAX O

IT O
WAS O
REPAIR O
GUN O
GLUE O

The O
deck B-AS

We O
ended O
up O
staying O
four O
nights O
and O
every O
morning O
around O
8AM O
or O
9AM O
we O
would O
be O
woken O
up O
by O
the O
housekeeping B-AS

They O
could O
increase B-OP
their O
business B-AS
through O
making O
smart B-OP
choices B-AS

who O
, O
unlike O
Dean O

can O
make O
good B-OP
decisions B-AS
for O
the O
customers O
in O
their O
casino O
. O

Resort B-AS
fees I-AS
are O
usually B-OP
included I-OP
with O
the O
price O
of O
the O

For O
what O
we O
paid O
I O
have O
no B-OP

I O
got O
in O

the O

was O
as O
polite B-OP
( O
and O
awake B-OP
) O
as O
he O
would O
have O
been O
at O
noon O
. O

Getting O
in O
can O
be O
difficult O
later O
in O
the O
night O
, O
the O
line B-AS
was O
insane B-OP
, O
but O
the O
inside B-AS
was O
beautiful B-OP
! O

but O
I O
believe O
we O
were O
paying O
for O
the O
quality B-OP
ingredients O

Customer B-AS
service I-AS
is O
great B-OP
and O
always O
there O
to O

The O
only O
negative B-OP
comment O
I O
have O
, O
was O
the O
carpet B-AS

we O

A O
fairly B-OP
nice I-OP

lets O
just O
say O
not O

one O
of O
the O
more B-OP

hotels B-AS
on O

I O
was O
horrified B-OP
at O
the O
poor B-OP
level I-OP

Excellent B-OP

no B-OP
coffee B-AS
in O

and O
the O
bottled B-AS
water I-AS
in O
the O
rooms O
is O
a O
super B-OP
ridiculous I-OP
price I-OP
if O
you O
open O
or O
take O
them O
, O
so O
you O
're O
better O
off O
taking O

When O

this O

not B-OP
a O
bad O

right O
across O
from O
Penn O

just O
a O
few B-OP
steps O
from O

Now O
to O
the O
really B-OP
bad I-OP
part O
of O
my O
stay O
. O

We O
love B-OP
GVR O
. O

We O
enjoyed B-OP
Pinnacles B-AS
Resort I-AS
so O
much O
that O
we O
booked O
another O
weeks O
holiday O
in O
January O
of O
2012 O
when O
my O
mother O
visited O
from O
the O
USA O
. O

Then O
last O
year O
one O
of O
our O
friends O
recommended O
Elk O
Springs O
and O
we O
are O
now O
customer O
for O
life O
. O

Lovely B-OP
place B-AS
. O

The O
breakfasts B-AS
were O
delicious B-OP
and O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
incredibly B-OP
accommodating I-OP
. O

Close B-OP
to O
the O
airport B-AS
rail I-AS
and O
Merdeka B-AS

one O
of O

You O
can O
actually O
hear O
what O
your O
date O
is O
saying O
& O
it O
's O
never B-OP
crowded O
here O

alhamdulilah O
, O
mashaallah O

Overall O
, O
I O
think O
I O
paid O
more O
than O
I O
should O
have O
for O
this O
kind O
of O
hotel B-AS
( O
around O
$ O
175/night O
) O

Was O
online O
for O
hours O
with O
a O
unique B-OP
message B-AS
and O
number B-AS
to O
call O
. O

All O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
$ O
15 O
was O
worth O
it O
. O

There O
's O
a O
great B-OP
view B-AS
from O
almost O
every O
point O
in O
the O
room O
& O
the O
acoustics B-AS
are O
n't B-OP
shabby I-OP
at I-OP
all I-OP
. O

Rooms B-AS
were O
very B-OP
clean I-OP
. O

This O
year O
the O
big B-OP
attraction B-AS
is O
The O
Walking O
Dead O
, O
which O
has O
a O
spooky B-OP
haunted B-AS
house I-AS
to O
go O
along O
with O
it O
, O
but O
also O
features O
set B-AS
- O
pieces O
from O
the O
show O
( O
including O
Dale O
's O
trailer O
and O
Morgan O
's O
booby O
traps O
) O
and O
zombies B-AS
trudging O
around O
and O
scaring O
the O
bejeezus O
out O
of O
people O
. O

The O
meal O
ended O
up O
costing O
a O
bit O
more O
than O
I O
would O
have O
expected O
for O
the O
size O
of O
the O
dishes O

So O
the O
main B-AS
Polar I-AS
Bear I-AS
lift I-AS
fits B-OP
6 I-OP
people I-OP
... O
but O
that O
's O
not O
much O
when O
you O
have O
500 O
people O
lined O
up O
to O
get O
up O
. O

I O
would O
n't B-OP
recommend I-OP
this O
place B-AS
. O

I O
just O
ca O
n't O
thank O
you O
enough O
! O

My O
key B-AS
card I-AS
did O
n't B-OP
work I-OP

I O
've O
got O
ta O
say O
. O

Went O
to O
get O
in O
the O
shower O
, O
NOW O
there O
's O
no B-OP
hot O
water B-AS
anywhere O
. O

We O
came O
with O
our O
four O
children O
and O
we O
all O
had O
a O
blast B-OP
staying B-AS
in O
a O
roomy B-OP
suite B-AS
, O
complete O
with O
two O
separate O
bedrooms B-AS
, O
an O
open B-OP
and O
roomy B-OP
living B-AS
room I-AS
, O
full B-OP
bathroom B-AS
, O
kitchenette B-AS
/ O
dining B-AS
area I-AS
with O
a O
mini B-OP
fridge B-AS
and O
microwave B-AS
. O

I O
went O
down O
to O
the O
bar O
for O
a O
burger B-AS
and O
fries O
. O

The O
dishes B-AS
are O
small B-OP
, O
and O
they O
tend O
to O
the O
expensive O
side O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
really B-OP
good I-OP
price B-AS
for O
a O
Michelin O
Star O
restaurant O
. O

The O
General B-AS
Manager I-AS
Amy O
Price O
is O
out O
of O
the O
town O
apparently O
and O
the O
Desk O
Manager O
ca O
n't O
give O
a O
letter O
saying O
the O
hotel O
is O
responsible O
for O
what O
happens O
today O
. O

We O
left O
satisfied O
but O
a O
bit B-OP
hungry I-OP
. O

So O
much O
better O
than O
the O
usual O
juice O
and O
muffins O
. O

The O
service B-AS
is O
awesome B-OP
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
great B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
. O

Elk B-AS
Springs I-AS
Resort I-AS
Cabins I-AS
are O
best B-OP
available I-OP
in O
Smokies O
. O

It O
is O
also O
great B-OP
to O
go O
just O
for O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
which O
is O
really B-OP
comfortable I-OP
and O
chill B-OP
. O

They O
go O
above O
and O
beyond O
expectations O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
it O
's O
close O
to O
just O
about O
everything O
! O

Location B-AS
is O
good B-OP
, O
but O
their O
are O
better B-OP
hotels B-AS
and O
better B-OP
values B-AS
in O
the O
neighborhood B-AS
. O

Everything O
from O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
to O
unique B-OP
appeal B-AS
gets O
5 B-OP
stars I-OP
. O

Perfect B-OP
downtown B-AS
location I-AS

Even O
now O
that O
I O
live O
in O
Austin O

I O
would O
stay O
here O
again O
and O
recommend O
this O
Howard O
Johnson O
. O

All O
of O
my O
friends O
told O
me O
that O
I O
had O
to O
visit O
here O

Great B-OP
place B-AS
to O
stay O

City B-AS
view I-AS
is O
fine B-OP
, O
water B-AS
view I-AS
is O
spectacular B-OP
. O

This O
was O
the O
only O
hotel B-AS
we O
went O
to O
every O
time O
. O

They O
charged B-OP
extra I-OP
for O
the O
parking B-AS
, O
which O
is O
listed O
in O
the O
parking O
lot O
as O
$ O
17 O
for O
self B-AS
parking I-AS
, O
but O
was O
$ B-OP
18 I-OP
inside O
. O

There O
s O
just O
a B-OP
ton I-OP
of I-OP
people B-AS
inside O
. O

There O
is O
no B-OP
real O
justification O
for O
this O
, O
apart O
from O
not O
having O
a O
choice O
once O
you O
have O
arrived O
and O
many O
tourists O
wanting O
to O
make O
Key O
West O
a O
vacation O
stop O
( O
often O
having O
to O
drive O
for O
4 O
- O
5 O
hours O
from O
Miami O
) O
. O

The O
accommodations B-AS
were O
ok B-OP
. O

Did O
n't O
have O
to O
much O
experience O
with O
staff O
other O
than O
I O
was O
a O
little O
concerned O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
once O
see O
Security O
working O
in O
their O
parking O
area O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
very B-OP
much I-OP
enjoyed I-OP
our O
stay B-AS
at O
the O
Alamo B-AS
. O

The O
breakfast B-AS
buffet I-AS
is O
good B-OP
, O
no B-OP
complaints I-OP
. O

I O
just O
ca O
nt O
believe O
the O
poor B-OP
level I-OP
of I-OP
customer B-AS
service I-AS
they O
provide O
. O

Just O
a O
nice B-OP
stay B-AS
at O
the O
hotel B-AS
. O

Ever O
since O
the O
remodel B-AS
it O
is O
awesome B-OP
! O
! O
! O

It O
offers O
quaint B-OP
table B-AS
seating I-AS
outside O
in O
the O
summer O
months O
. O

Pity O
because O
the O
hotel B-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
! O

This O
hotel B-AS
has O
been O
visited B-OP
by I-OP
several I-OP
generations I-OP
of O
Californians O
and O
remains O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
in O
the O
state O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
's O
a O
great B-OP
location B-AS
, O
the O
hotel B-AS
's O
OK B-OP
if O
you O
're O
aware O
of O
the O
extra B-OP
costs B-AS
, O
but O
would O
n't O
stay O
again O
. O

( O
Thanks O
Alex O
! O
) O

Obviously O
i O
expect O
to O
be O
packed O
since O
it O
was O
Saturday O
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
friendly B-OP
and O
great B-OP
at O
enforcing O
the O
crowds O
, O
with O
That O
Guy O
at O
the O
9:30 O
Club O
being O
the O
name O
of O
a O
staffmember O
that O
pretty O
much O
everyone O
in O
DC O
could O
probably O
recognise O
... O

I O
went O
to O
the O
restaurant O
assuming O
the O
door O
would O
shut O
after O
me O
and O
came O
back O
to O
wide B-OP
open I-OP
door O
. O

Pretends O
to O
be O
high B-OP
class I-OP
by O
charging O
like O
mad O
. O

Comfortable B-OP
and O
neat B-OP
. O

Another O
call O
to O
the O
front O
desk O
and O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
engineer O
. O

Then O
we O
got O
to O
our O
room O
, O
no B-OP
Air B-AS
Conditioning I-AS
or O
hot B-AS
water I-AS
, O
in O
the O
bathroom O
sink O
shower O
worked O
. O

The O
happy B-AS
hour I-AS
has O
good B-OP
prices I-OP
, O
but O
the O
food B-AS
servings I-AS
are O
considerably B-OP
smaller I-OP
. O

The O
show O
was O
in O
the O
back O
room O
which O
holds O
maybe B-OP
50 I-OP
people I-OP
. O

Very B-OP
good I-OP
quality B-AS
and O
no B-OP
so I-OP
expensive I-OP
. O

Definitely O
wo O
n't O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
. O

There O
is O
also O
2 B-OP
restaurants B-AS
which O
is O
very B-OP
convenient I-OP
for O
the O
guests O
. O

Before O
hand O
we O
were O
hanging O
out O
in O
the O
bar B-AS
downstairs O
which O
is O
nice B-OP
and O
we O
even O
spent O
sometime O
in O
the O
lounge O
upstairs O
. O

Very B-OP
good I-OP
hotel B-AS
can O
not O
fault O
the O
staff B-AS

but O
compared O
to O
the O
newer B-OP
properties B-AS
on O
the O
strip O
, O
it O
's O
smaller B-OP

but O
in O
peak O
season O
I O
can O
see O
things O
getting O
a O
little B-OP
crowded I-OP
. O

Housekeeping B-AS
Lynn O
gets O
A+ O
. O

We O
stayed O
in O
the O
Atrium O
building O
. O

Will O
go O
back O
in O
about O
2 O
or O
3 O
months O
. O

Lift B-AS
tickets I-AS
are O
stupid B-OP
pricey I-OP
EVEN O
WHEN O
HALF O

The O
check B-AS
in I-AS
process O
was O
awful B-OP
. O

The O
only O
drawback B-OP
is O
the O
internet B-AS
connection I-AS
. O

I O
did O
n't B-OP
even O
sleep O
and O
felt O
I O
should O
n't O
pay O
full O
price O
for O
something O
I O
was O
dissatisfied O
with O
. O

Best O
yet O
clean O
, O
full O
of O
great B-OP
surprise B-AS
. O

My O
new O
bride O
and O
me O
really O
had O
a O
great B-OP
time B-AS
. O

The O
staff B-AS
is O
friendly B-OP
and O
the O

We O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
researching O
all O
of O
the O
accommodation B-AS
in O
Key O
West O
and O
chose O
Casa B-AS
Marina I-AS
because O
it O
is O
part O
of O
The O
Waldorf O
Astoria O
group O
, O
which O
is O
a O
name O
you O
associate O
with O
luxury B-OP
and O
quality B-OP
, O
but O
also O
because O
of O
the O
good B-OP
reviews B-AS
the O
hotel O
has O
received O
. O

However O
, O
when O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O

we O
found O
out O
that O
the O
one O

that O

not O
expect O
high O

You O
'll O
find O
yourself O
in O

very O
soon O
. O

The O
accommodations B-AS
were O
less B-OP
than I-OP
superb I-OP
to O
put O
it O
kindly O
. O

At O
least O
two O
clerks O
indicated O
they O
were O
perplexed O
that O
we O
were O
being O
charged O
for O
two O
rooms O
but O
the O
manager O
would O
not O
change O

we O
owe O
that O
to O
the O

at O
the O
Paramount O
. O

We O
repeatedly O
forgot O
to O
lock O
our O
safe O
, O
and O
rather O
than O
worrying O
anything O
was O
missing O
, O
they O
left O
us O
notes O
reminding O
us O
that O
it O
was O
open O
. O

We O
enjoyed B-OP
being O
right O
in O
the O
middle B-AS
of I-AS
downtown I-AS
, O
just O
a O
short B-OP
walk B-AS
to O

to O
rely O
on O
cleanliness B-AS

the O
city B-AS
center I-AS
, O
near B-OP
to I-OP
the O
most B-OP
beautiful I-OP

! O

Not O
a O
huge O
deal B-AS
, O
but O
we O
did O
pay O
extra O

it O
