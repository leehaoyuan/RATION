their O
sake B-AS
list I-AS
was O
extensive B-OP
, O
but O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
purple O
haze O
, O
which O
was O
n O
' O
t O
listed O
but O
made O
for O
us O
upon O
request O
! O

the O
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
was O
unusually O
good B-OP
and O
the O
rock B-AS
shrimp I-AS
tempura I-AS
was O
awesome B-OP
, O
great O
appetizer O
to O
share O
! O

we O
love B-OP
th O
pink B-AS

this O
place B-AS
has O
got O
to O
be O
the O
best B-OP
japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
new O
york O
area O
. O

i O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B-AS
urchin I-AS
, O
which O
was O
heavenly B-OP
at O
sushi O
rose O
. O

the O
prix B-AS
fixe I-AS
menu I-AS
is O
worth B-OP
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
( O
both O
in O
quantity O
and O
quality O
) O
. O

the O
food B-AS
here O
is O
rather O
good B-OP
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
like O
to O
wait O
for O
it O
. O

also O
, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B-AS
spicy O
- O
its O
rather O
bland B-OP
if O
you O
do O
n O
' O
t O
. O

the O
ambience B-AS
is O
pretty B-OP
and O
nice B-OP
for O
conversation O
, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch O
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best B-OP
. O

it O
was O
horrible B-OP
. O

have O
been O
dozens O
of O
times O
and O
never O
failed O
to O
enjoy B-OP
the O
experience O
. O

make O
sure O
you O
try O
this O
place B-AS
as O
often B-OP
as O
you O
can O
. O

i O

fresh B-OP
restaurant B-AS
was O
amazing B-OP

delicious B-OP
and O
of O
course O
fresh B-OP
. O

hats B-OP
off I-OP
to O
the O
chef B-AS
. O

this O
is O
some O
really O
good B-OP
, O
inexpensive B-OP
sushi B-AS
. O

this O
place B-AS
is O
always O
very O
crowded B-OP
and O
popular B-OP
. O

and O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
pastis B-AS
is O
simply O
wonderful B-OP
. O

i O
' O
m O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy B-OP
food B-AS
. O

the O
hanger B-AS
steak I-AS
was O
like O
rubber B-OP
and O
the O
tuna B-AS
was O
flavorless B-OP
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

big O
thumbs B-OP
up I-OP
! O

the O
pizza B-AS
and O
wine B-AS
were O
excellent B-OP
- O
the O
service B-AS
too O
- O
- O
but O
what O
really O
made O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard B-AS
dining I-AS
area I-AS
. O

it O
is O
one O
the O
nicest B-OP
outdoor B-AS
restaurants I-AS
i O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
ny O
- O
- O
i O
am O
from O
italy O

rivals O
the O

it O
is O
simply O
amazing B-OP
. O

beautiful B-OP
experience O
. O

the O
menu B-AS
is O
very O
limited B-OP
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

we O
will O
go O
back O
every O
time O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
. O

the O
characters B-AS
really O
make O
for O
an O
enjoyable B-OP
experience O
. O

however O
, O
i O
think O
jeckll B-AS
and I-AS
hydes I-AS
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun B-OP
to O
do O
once O
. O

we O
had O
a O
good B-OP
time O
. O

a O
little O
overpriced B-OP
but O
worth B-OP
it O
once O
you O
take O
a O
bite O
. O

i O
have O
lived O
in O
japan O
for O
7 O
years O

) O
. O

eat O
at O
your O
own O
risk O
. O
