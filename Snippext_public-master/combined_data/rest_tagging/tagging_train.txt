judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B-AS
, O
but O
not B-OP
any I-OP
longer I-OP
. O

we O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B-AS
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude B-OP
. O

they O
never O
brought O
us O
complimentary O
noodles O
, O
ignored O
repeated O
requests O
for O
sugar O
, O
and O
threw O
our O
dishes O
on O
the O
table O
. O

the O
food B-AS
was O
lousy B-OP
- O
too B-OP
sweet I-OP
or O
too B-OP
salty I-OP
and O
the O
portions B-AS
tiny B-OP
. O

after O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained B-OP
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip O
. O

avoid B-OP
this O
place B-AS
! O

i O
have O
eaten O
at O
saul O
, O
many O
times O
, O
the O
food B-AS
is O
always O
consistently O
, O
outrageously B-OP
good I-OP
. O

saul B-AS
is O
the O
best B-OP
restaurant O
on O
smith O
street O
and O
in O
brooklyn O
. O

the O
duck B-AS
confit I-AS
is O
always O
amazing B-OP
and O
the O
foie B-AS
gras I-AS
terrine I-AS
with I-AS
figs I-AS
was O
out B-OP
of I-OP
this I-OP
world I-OP
. O

the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
interesting B-OP
and O
has O
many O
good B-OP
values I-OP
. O

for O
the O
price O
, O
you O
can O
not O
eat O
this O
well B-OP
in O
manhattan O
. O

i O
was O
very O
disappointed B-OP
with O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

ive O
asked O
a O
cart B-AS
attendant I-AS
for O
a O
lotus O
leaf O
wrapped O
rice O
and O
she O
replied O
back O
rice O
and O
just O
walked O
away O
. O

i O
had O
to O
ask O
her O
three O
times O
before O
she O
finally O
came O
back O
with O
the O
dish O
ive O
requested O
. O

food B-AS
was O
okay B-OP
, O
nothing B-OP
great I-OP
. O

chow B-AS
fun I-AS
was O
dry B-OP
; O
pork B-AS
shu I-AS
mai I-AS
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy B-OP
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud B-OP
and O
rude B-OP
family O
. O

i O
/ O
we O
will O
never B-OP
go I-OP
back I-OP
to O
this O
place B-AS
again O
. O

went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster O
binge O
, O
with O
fish B-AS
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
i O
am O
so O
glad B-OP
this O
was O
the O
place O
it O
o O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great B-OP
! O

service B-AS
was O
devine B-OP
, O
oysters B-AS
where O
a O
sensual B-OP
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price O
ca O
n O
' O
t O
be O
beat O
! O
! O
! O

you O
ca O
n O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

every O
time O
in O
new O
york O
i O
make O
it O
a O
point O
to O
visit O
restaurant B-AS
saul I-AS
on O
smith O
street O
. O

everything O
is O
always O
cooked O
to O
perfection B-OP
, O
the O
service B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP
, O
the O
decor B-AS
cool B-OP
and O
understated B-OP
. O

i O
had O
the O
duck B-AS
breast I-AS
special I-AS
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible B-OP
. O

and O
i O
hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
i O
doubt B-OP
i O
' O
ll O
ever O
go O
back O
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
very O
average B-OP
. O
. O
. O
the O
thai B-AS
fusion I-AS
stuff I-AS
is O
a O
bit O
too B-OP
sweet I-OP
, O
every O
thing O
they O
serve O
is O
too B-OP
sweet I-OP
here O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
i O
moderately O
enjoyed B-OP
was O
their O
grilled B-AS
chicken I-AS
special I-AS
with I-AS
edamame I-AS
puree I-AS
. O

i O
had O
never O
had O
edamame B-AS
pureed I-AS
before O
but O
i O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative B-OP
and O
tasty B-OP
( O
could O
' O
ve O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
) O
. O

the O
decor B-AS
is O
night B-OP
tho O
. O
. O
. O
but O
they O
really O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-AS
in O
the O
ceiling O
. O
. O
. O
its O
quite O
un B-OP
- I-OP
appetizing I-OP
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-AS
look O
sleek B-OP
and O
modern B-OP
. O

we O
went O
around O
9 O
: O
30 O
on O
a O
friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-AS
was O
great B-OP
! O

the O
perfect B-OP
spot B-AS
. O

food B-AS
- O
awesome B-OP
. O

service B-AS
- O
friendly B-OP
and O
attentive B-OP
. O

ambiance B-AS
- O
relaxed B-OP
and O
stylish B-OP
. O

do O
n O
' O
t O
judge O
this O
place B-AS
prima O
facie O
, O
you O
have O
to O
try O
it O
to O
believe O
it O
, O
a O
home O
away O
from O
home O
for O
the O
literate O
heart O
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
decent B-OP
. O

however O
, O
it O
' O
s O
the O
service B-AS
that O
leaves O
a O
bad B-OP
taste I-OP
in O
my O
mouth O
. O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self O
- O
respect O
, O
which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B-AS
intimidate O
me O
, O
i O
. O
e O
. O
make O
me O
feel O
bad B-OP
asking O
for O
trivialities O
like O
water O
, O
or O
the O
check O
. O

i O
know O
, O
you O
were O
too O
busy O
showing O
off O
your O
vintage O
tee O
shirt O
and O
looking O
bored O
, O
but O
my O
agenda O
is O
i O
' O
m O
here O
to O
eat O
and O
enjoy O
the O
company O
of O
friends O
, O
seeking O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

well O
, O
i O
did O
n O
' O
t O
find O
it O
there O
, O
and O
trust O
, O
i O
have O
told O
everyone O
i O
can O
think O
of O
about O
my O
experience O
. O

the O
last O
time O
i O
walked O
by O
it O
looked O
pretty O
empty B-OP
. O
hmmm O
. O

i O
had O
a O
great B-OP
experience O
. O

food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

service B-AS
is O
top B-OP
notch I-OP
. O

i O
have O
been O
going O
back O
again O
and O
again O
. O

it O
melted O
in O
my O
little O
mouth O
and O
the O
perfect B-OP
consistency I-OP
- O
not O
too O
fishy O
, O
creamy O
, O
and O
slightly O
buttery O
. O

the O
sushi B-AS
seemed O
pretty O
fresh B-OP
and O
was O
adequately O
proportioned B-OP
. O

the O
rice B-AS
to I-AS
fish I-AS
ration I-AS
was O
also O
good B-OP
- O
- O
they O
did O
n O
' O
t O
try O
to O
overpack O
the O
rice O
. O

we O
took O
advanatage O
of O
the O
half B-AS
price I-AS
sushi I-AS
deal I-AS
on O
saturday O
so O
it O
was O
well O
worth B-OP
it O
. O

surprisingly B-OP
nothing O
could O
be O
further O
from O
the O
truth O
. O

in O
the O
evening O
, O
this O
place O
attracted B-OP
a O
well O
dressed O
, O
with O
it O
, O
ny O
crowd B-AS
. O

the O
food B-AS
was O
well B-OP
prepared I-OP
and O
the O
service B-AS
impecable B-OP
. O

i O
' O
m O
going O
back O
. O

quite O
simply O
it O
' O
s O
like O
stepping O
out O
of O
manhattan O
and O
into O
a O
haven O
of O
tranquility B-OP
. O

i O
will O
be O
going O
back O
and O
heartily O
recommend B-OP
it O
! O

it O
is O
terrific B-OP
, O
as O
is O
the O
value O
. O

$ O
6 O
and O
there O
is O
much O
tasty B-OP
food B-AS
, O
all O
of O
it O
fresh B-OP
and O
continually O
refilled B-OP
. O

i O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B-AS
were O
great B-OP
. O

go O
hungry O
and O
enjoy B-OP
. O

i O
like B-OP
the O
somosas B-AS
, O
chai B-AS
, O
and O
the O
chole B-AS
, O
but O
the O
dhosas B-AS
and O
dhal B-AS
were O
kinda O
disappointing B-OP
. O

the O
service B-AS
varys B-OP
from O
day O
to O
day O
- O
sometimes O
they O
' O
re O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

the O
kitchen B-AS
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow B-OP
. O

if O
you O
' O
ve O
ever O
been O
along O
the O
river O
in O
weehawken O
you O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
top O
of O
view B-AS
the O
chart O
house O
has O
to O
offer O
. O

add O
to O
that O
great B-OP
service B-AS
and O
great B-OP
food B-AS
at O
a O
reasonable O
price O
and O
you O
have O
yourself O
the O
beginning O
of O
a O
great O
evening O
. O

the O
lava B-AS
cake I-AS
dessert I-AS
was O
incredible B-OP
and O
i O
recommend B-OP
it O
. O

once O
you O
step O
into O
cosette B-AS
, O
you O
' O
re O
miraculously O
in O
a O
small O
, O
off B-OP
- I-OP
the I-OP
- I-OP
beaten I-OP
path O
parisian O
bistro O
. O

this O
tiny B-OP
restaurant B-AS
is O
as O
cozy B-OP
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
parisian O
flair O
. O

the O
food B-AS
was O
average B-OP
to I-OP
above I-OP
- I-OP
average I-OP
; O
the O
french B-AS
onion I-AS
soup I-AS
filling O
yet O
not B-OP
overly I-OP
impressive I-OP
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-AS
not B-OP
brilliant I-OP
in O
any O
way O
. O

however O
, O
go O
for O
the O
ambience B-AS
, O
and O
consider O
the O
food B-AS
just O
a O
companion O
for O
a O
trip O
across O
the O
world O
! O

the O
pizza B-AS
was O
delivered O
cold B-OP
and O
the O
cheese B-AS
was B-OP
n I-OP
' I-OP
t I-OP
even I-OP
fully I-OP
melted I-OP
! O

it O
looked O
like O
shredded O
cheese O
partly O
done O
- O
still O
in O
strips O
. O

this O
has O
got O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
overrated B-OP
restaurants O
in O
brooklyn O
. O

the O
pizza B-AS
is O
overpriced B-OP
and O
soggy B-OP
. O

yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy B-OP
ingredients B-AS
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients O
do O
n O
' O
t O
make O
for O
good B-OP
pizza B-AS
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust B-AS
right O
. O

a O
big O
disappointment B-OP
, O
all O
around O
. O

i O
think O
i O
' O
ve O
had O
some O
the O
best B-OP
meals B-AS
of O
my O
life O
at O
minnow O
. O

the O
seafood B-AS
is O
amazing B-OP
, O
there O
' O
s O
a O
good B-OP
wine B-AS
list I-AS
, O
and O
the O
ever B-OP
- I-OP
changing I-OP
menu B-AS
always O
offers O
some O
great B-OP
surprises I-OP
. O

the O
combination O
of O
super B-OP
- I-OP
fresh I-OP
ingredients B-AS
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual B-OP
but O
really O
delicious B-OP
. O

worth B-OP
the O
trip O
from O
manhattan O
. O

best B-OP
pastrami B-AS
i O
ever O
had O
and O
great B-OP
portion B-AS
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

my O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-AS
shrimp I-AS
which O
are O
huge B-OP
and O
loved B-OP
it O
. O

as O
a O
japanese O
native O
, O
i O
' O
ve O
lived O
in O
the O
tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
i O
was O
just O
so O
amazed B-OP
at O
this O
place B-AS
. O

this O
place B-AS
is O
the O
most O
japanese B-OP
it O
can O
ever O
get O
. O

the O
signs B-AS
, O
the O
specials B-AS
menus I-AS
, O
food B-AS
, O
and O
even O
all O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
are O
all O
totally O
japanese B-OP
. O

this O
place B-AS
is O
worth B-OP
an O
one O
- O
hour O
drive O
. O

i O
am O
so O
coming O
back O
here O
again O
, O
as O
much O
as O
i O
can O

this O
is O
by O

my O
favorite B-OP

is O
excellent B-OP
, O
the O

i O
' O
m O
partial B-OP
to O
the O

incredibly O
tiny B-OP
. O

they O
refuse B-OP
to O
seat O
parties O
of O
3 O
or O
more O
on O
weekends O
. O

the O
hostess B-AS
is O
rude B-OP
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive B-OP
. O

the O
food B-AS
was O
bland B-OP
oily I-OP
. O

i O
just O
do O
n O
' O
t O
understand O
all O
the O
hype B-OP
. O
. O
. O

we O
have O
been O

many O
times O
, O
and O
always O
have O
great B-OP
food B-AS
, O

and O
service B-AS
. O

we O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O

but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short B-OP
wait B-AS

a O
great B-OP
glass B-AS

in O
the O
appetizer O
section O
. O

those O
rolls B-AS
were O
big B-OP
, O
but O
not B-OP
good I-OP
and O

n I-OP
' I-OP
t I-OP

admittedly O
some O
nights O

the O
restaurant B-AS

, O
gigondas B-AS

the O

when O

when O

the O

and O
they O
would O
still O
be O
better B-OP
than O
any O
else O
. O

worth B-OP
visiting O
the O
1st B-AS
ave I-AS
spot I-AS
because O

is O
the O
original O

try O
the O
lobster B-AS
teriyaki I-AS

very O
good B-OP

food B-AS
was O
very O
good B-OP

( O
though O
i O
wish O
the O
pork B-AS
belly I-AS
that O
i O
ordered O
was O
roasted O
a O

was O
pleasant B-OP
though O
the O

was O
rather O
noisy B-OP
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O

able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O

i O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
at O

8 O
times O

it O

probably O
still O
the O
best B-OP
indian O
restaurant O
around O

square O
. O

to O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
service B-AS
varies O
from O
good B-OP
to O
mediorce B-OP
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average B-OP
ok I-OP
. O

seating B-AS

always O
prompt B-OP
, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

food B-AS
is O
usually O
very O
good B-OP
, O
though O
ocasionally O
i O
wondered B-OP
about I-OP
freshmess I-OP
of O
raw B-AS
vegatables I-AS
in I-AS
side I-AS
orders I-AS
. O

as O
many O
other O
reviewers O
noticed O
, O
your O
order O
is O
often O
slow O
to O
arrive O
- O
this O
is O
particularly O
true O
in O
the O
evening O
but O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
during O
lunch O
time O
. O

the O
decor B-AS
is O
vibrant B-OP
and O
eye B-OP
- I-OP
pleasing I-OP
with O
several O
semi B-AS
- I-AS
private I-AS
boths I-AS
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall O
, O
which O
are O
great B-OP
for O
a O

. O

i O
have O
never B-OP
been I-OP

completely O
taken B-OP
by O
the O

, O
i O
ordered O
the O

. O

you O
can O
not O
go O
wrong B-OP
at O
the O

if O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O
upper O
east O
side O
, O
we O
would O
genuinely O
miss B-OP
this O
restaurant B-AS

the O
restaurant B-AS

cute B-OP
but O
not B-OP
upscale I-OP
. O

the O
food B-AS

a O
diamond B-OP
in O

this O
restaurant B-AS
was O
way O
overhyped B-OP
. O

my O
chow B-AS

and I-AS
chow I-AS

was O
really O
bland B-OP
and O
oily B-OP
. O

okay O
- O
i O
do O
n O
' O
t O
mind O
the O
oily O
part O
( O
cause O
most O
are O
cooked O
that O
way O
) O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
bland B-OP
. O

the O
scallion B-AS
pancakes I-AS
and O
fried B-AS
dumplings I-AS
were O
nothing B-OP
out I-OP
of I-OP
the I-OP
ordinary I-OP
. O

the O
service B-AS
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good B-OP
about O
this O
restaurant B-AS
. O

it O
' O
s O
boring B-OP
on O
the O
inside O
, O
and O
our O
sushi B-AS
was O
pretty O
below B-OP
average I-OP
. O
. O
. O
the O
tuna B-AS
was O
soggy B-OP
and O
the O
other O
rolls B-AS
had O
no B-OP
flavor I-OP
. O

i O
definitely O
would O
n O
' O
t O
go O
back O
. O

their O
pad B-AS
penang I-AS
is O
delicious B-OP
and O
everything O
else O
is O
fantastic B-OP
. O

the O
price O
is O
reasonable B-OP
although O
the O
service B-AS
is O
poor B-OP
. O

great B-OP
for O
a O
romantic B-OP
evening O
, O
or O
a O
fun B-OP
evening O
with O

. O
. O
. O

the O

both O
refreshing B-OP

my O

perfect B-OP
, O
my O

well B-OP
done I-OP

dry B-OP

i O
did O
n O
' O
t O
complain O
, O
i O
liked B-OP
the O
atmosphere B-AS
so O
much O
. O

on O
a O
hot O
day O
it O
was O
fabulous B-OP
to O
stop O
in O
and O
enjoy O
lunch O
. O

ambience B-AS
is O
so O
cute B-OP
and O
quaint B-OP
, O
good B-OP
for O
business O
although O
we O
were O
there O
on O
vacation O
. O

salads B-AS
were O
fantastic B-OP
. O

although O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
regular O
lettuce O
and O
some O
walnuts O
the O
salads B-AS
we O
got O
were O
great B-OP
. O

ingredients B-AS
are O
organic B-OP
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus B-OP
for O
me O
. O

we O
will O
be O
back O
. O

the O
spicy B-AS
tuna I-AS
roll I-AS
is O
huge B-OP
and O
probably O
the O
best B-OP
that O
i O
' O
ve O
had O
at O
this O
price O
range O
. O

the O
yellowtail B-AS
was O
particularly O
good B-OP
as O
well O
. O

i O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
all B-AS
you I-AS
can I-AS
eat I-AS
deal I-AS
, O
however O
- O
- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited B-OP
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food O
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu O
. O

in O
any O
event O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place B-AS
i O
' O
ll O
be O
sure O
to O
stop O
by O
again O
when O
i O
' O

big B-AS

the O

literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast B-OP

the O
food O

it O
all O

at O
a O
very O
reasonable B-OP

no O
more O

$ O
3 O
- O
6 O
each O
) O
. O

the O
takeout B-AS
is O
great B-OP
too O
since O
they O
give O
high O
quality O
tupperware O
as O
well O
. O

enjoyed B-OP
a O
very O
nice B-OP
caesar B-AS
salad I-AS
while O
my O
wife O
had O
arugula B-AS
and I-AS
goat I-AS
cheese I-AS
. O
. O
. O
. O
both O
very O
tasty B-OP
. O

we O
both O
opted O
for O
a O
pasta B-AS
dish I-AS
and O
they O
were O
served B-OP
timely I-OP
and O
fresh B-OP
. O

we O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu B-AS
chocolate I-AS
cake I-AS
, O
both O
were O
delicious B-OP
. O

we O
' O
d O
go O
back O
again O

i O
recently O
went O
to O
this O
restaurant B-AS
with O
some O
co O
- O
workers O
for O
lunch O
and O
had O
an O
amazing B-OP
time I-OP
. O

the O
staff B-AS
was O
accomodating B-OP
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
absolutely O
delicious B-OP
and O
the O
place B-AS
is O
lovely B-OP
. O

we O
even O
had O
a O
visit O
from O
the O
manager B-AS
who O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
were O
enjoying O
ourselves O
. O

yes O
, O
the O
prices O
are O
high B-OP
, O
but O
i O
felt O
it O
was O
worth B-OP
it O
. O

we O
all O
felt O
it O
was O
worth B-OP
it O
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
good B-OP
food B-AS
and O
ok B-OP
service B-AS
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad B-OP
food B-AS
and O
bad B-OP
service B-AS
, O
sometimes O
i O
get O
good B-OP
good B-AS
and O
bad B-OP
service B-AS
. O

it O
is O
not B-OP
consistent I-OP
. O

the O
place O

a O
bistro O
which O
means O
: O
simple B-OP
dishes B-AS

with O

of O
bitter B-OP
though O
) O
. O

my O
friend O
got O
the O
mushroom B-AS
pizza I-AS
which O
tasted O
better B-OP

the O
sangria B-AS
was O
pretty O
tasty B-OP
and O
good B-OP
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

kind O
of O
a O
small B-OP
place B-AS
but O
i O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

overall O
i O
would O
recommend B-OP
it O
and O
go O
back O
again O
. O

i O
started O
out O
with O
a O
bombay B-AS
beer I-AS

. O
it O
was O
delicious B-OP
. O

service B-AS
was O
slow B-OP

i O
go O

out O
at O
many O
different O
restaurants O
and O
this O
is O
one O
place B-AS
you O
have O
go O
and O
try O
. O

this O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B-AS
and O
service B-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
. O

the O
filet B-AS
mignon I-AS
dish I-AS
was O
superb B-OP
! O

i O
would O
defiantly O
come O
back O
here O
again O
as O
one O
of O
my O
top B-OP
choices I-OP

it O
' O

a O
small B-OP
cute B-OP
restaurant B-AS

i O
absolutely O
love B-OP
this O

! O

i O
like B-OP
the O
ambience B-AS

it O
' O
s O
very O
dark B-OP
and O
original B-OP
. O

the O
sushi B-AS

amazing B-OP
! O
! O
! O

and O
amazingly B-OP
cheap O
. O

very O
affordable B-OP
and O
excellent B-OP
ambient B-AS

we O
ordered O
some O
beef B-AS
and I-AS
noodle I-AS
soup I-AS
dishes I-AS
from O
the O
thai O
section O
of O
the O
menu O
but O
nothing O
we O
got O
was O
thai O
. O

we O
were O
very O
disappointed B-OP
. O

we O
wo O
n O
' O
t O
go O
to O
this O
place O
again O
for O
a O
good B-OP
meal B-AS

however O
, O
i O
think O
this O
place B-AS
is O
a O
good B-OP
hang O
out O
spot O
. O

my O
girlfriend O
and O
i O
stumbled O
onto O
this O
hopping O
place B-AS
the O
other O
night O
and O
had O
a O
great B-OP
time I-OP
! O

they O
tell O
me O
they O
are O
going O
to O
cover O
the O
garden O
in O
glass O
for O
the O
winter O
, O
so O
i O
' O
m O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
there O
on O
a O
snowy O
night O
to O
enjoy B-OP
it O
. O

check O
this O
place B-AS
out O
! O

highly O
recommended B-OP
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O

first O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B-AS
is O
* B-OP
not I-OP
* I-OP
romantic I-OP
, O
as O
claimed O
by O
citysearch O
' O
s O
editorial O
review O
. O

either O
that O
, O
or O
the O
editor O
' O
s O
idea O
of O

must O
be O
sharing O
a O
conversation O
with O
the O
next O
table O
, O
while O
trying O
to O
speak O
louder O
than O
the O
traffic O
on O
57th O
. O

the O
tables B-AS
are O
crammed B-OP
way O
too O
close B-OP
, O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
typical B-OP
of O
any O
italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
simply O
overpriced B-OP
. O

slightly O
above B-OP
average I-OP
wines B-AS
start O
at O
$ O
70 O
+ O
with O
only O
one O
selection O
listed O
at O
$ O
30 O
+ O
. O

service B-AS
is O
not B-OP
what I-OP
one I-OP
would I-OP
expect I-OP
from O
a O
joint O
in O
this O
price O
category O
. O

for O
instance O
, O
plates O
were O
just O
dumped O
on O
the O
table O
, O
i O
was O
handed O
the O
wine O
list O
upside O
down O
, O
etc O
. O
. O
. O
. O

somehow O
working O
the O
italian O
charm O
with O
constant O
mille O
grazie O
does O
not B-OP
constitute I-OP
proper I-OP
service B-AS
. O

to O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-AS
, O
which O
was O
above B-OP
average I-OP
, O
but O
could O
n O
' O
t O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies B-OP
of O
teodora B-AS

not O
one O
of O
our O
meals B-AS

weird B-OP
rosemary B-AS

would O
never O
go O
there O
again O

we O
also O
left O

one O

this O

it O

. O

when O
my O

, O
there O
was O
a O
candle O
in O
it O
- O
not O
because O
anyone O
asked O
for O
one O
- O
but O
because O
the O
waiter B-AS
must O
have O
seen O
me O
opening O
my O
birthday O
card O
and O
gift O
, O
and O
said O
he O
knew O
it O

of O
some O

. O

truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive B-OP
waiter B-AS

i O
highly O
recommend B-OP
the O
restaurant B-AS
based O
on O
our O
experience O
last O
night O
. O

we O
ate O
at O
this O
thai O
place O
following O
the O
reviews O
but O
very O
unhappy B-OP
with O
the O
foods B-AS
. O

we O
thought O
that O
this O
place O
is O
using O
too O
much O
of O
msg O
cooking O
in O
the O
foods B-AS
. O

they O
do O
n O
' O
t O
concern O
much O
of O

health O
, O
just O
want O
to O
make O
money O
. O

please O
do O
n O
' O
t O
fool B-OP
us O
. O

i O
recommend B-OP
the O
jelly B-AS
fish I-AS
, O
drunken B-AS
chicken I-AS
and O
the O
soupy B-AS
dumplings I-AS
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-AS
fry I-AS
blue I-AS
crab I-AS
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
so O
cheap B-OP
and O
the O
waiters B-AS
are O
nice B-OP
. O

of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
crowded O
but O
who O
cares O
. O

authentic B-OP
shanghai O

i O
can O
not O
recommend O
a O
better O
shanghai O
place O
in O
new O
york O
. O

have O
frequented O
' O
ino O
for O
several O
years O
and O
the O
food B-AS
remains O
excellent B-OP
. O

cheese B-AS

a O
varied B-OP
delight I-OP

great B-OP
bargain I-OP

10 O
. O

the O
large B-OP
selection I-OP
of O
bruschettas B-AS
, O
paninis B-AS
, O
tramezzinis B-AS
keep O
the O
palate O
from O
stagnating O

( O
the O
asparagus B-AS
, O
truffle B-AS
oil I-AS
, O
parmesan B-AS
bruschetta I-AS
is O
a O
winner B-OP

the O
seasonal B-OP
, O
and O
always O
delicious B-OP
, O
specials B-AS
. O

definitely O
a O
neighborhood O
favorite B-OP
. O

i O
loved B-OP
this O
place B-AS
! O
! O

i O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
so O
great B-OP
and O
i O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded O
. O

i O
like B-OP
cafe B-AS
noir I-AS
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B-AS
who O
work O
there O
are O
evil B-OP
and O
incompetent B-OP
! O
! O

the O
service B-AS
was O
terrible B-OP
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

the O
waitress B-AS
, O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
concerned O
of O
looking O
good O
than O
actually O
waitressing O
. O

after O
dinner O
the O
manager B-AS
grabbed O
my O
boyfriend O
, O
asked O
him O
: O
where O
are O
you O
from O
. O
. O
. O
maybe O
you O
dont O
know O
how O
things O
work O
in O
america O
. O
. O
. O
and O
in O
the O
end O
stormed O
away O
almost O
teareyed O
yelling O
that O
tips O
are O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
survive O
on O
. O

we O
did O
tip O
, O
i O
guess O
the O
model O
/ O
waitress B-AS
just O
wanted O
more O
and O
complained O
to O
the O
manager O
. O

pizza B-AS
here O
is O
consistently O
good B-OP
. O

salads B-AS
are O
a O
delicious B-OP
way O
to O
begin O
the O
meal O
. O

it O
is O
thick B-OP
and O
slightly O
soggy B-OP
. O

decor B-AS
is O
charming B-OP
. O

service B-AS
is O
average B-OP
. O

what O
a O
great B-OP
place B-AS
. O

the O
ambience B-AS
was O
so O
fun B-OP
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great B-OP
, O
on O
top O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food B-AS
was O
really O
tasty B-OP
. O

i O
was O
n O
' O
t O
thrilled O
to O
have O
to O
wait O
on O
line O
for O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
but O
i O
guess O
that O
' O
s O
the O
price O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
popular O
place O
. O

i O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
sea O
if O
you O
like B-OP
thai B-AS
cuisine I-AS
! O

i O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst B-OP
customer B-AS
service I-AS
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O
. O

a O
gentleman B-AS
, O
maybe O
the O
manager O
, O
came O
to O
our O
table O
, O
and O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
smile O
or O
greeting O
asked O
for O
our O
order O
. O

while O
it O
is O
understandable O
that O
every O
place O
is O
indeed O
different O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
need O
to O
be O
uncourteous B-OP
to O
customers O
and O
downright O
rude B-OP
. O

never B-OP
again I-OP
! O

i O
absolutely O
loved B-OP
this O
place B-AS
. O

excellent B-OP
atmosphere B-AS
, O
delicious B-OP
dishes B-AS
good B-OP
and O
friendly B-OP
service B-AS
. O

this O
is O
can O
became O
on O
e O
of O
the O
ny O
italian O
food O
fare O
institutions O
. O

i O
think O
that O
it O
is O
absolutely O
brilliant B-OP
and O
well B-OP
runned I-OP
business O
operation O
. O

the O
wine B-AS
list I-AS
is O
also O
really O
nice B-OP
. O

i O
have O
been O
to O
casimir B-AS
over O
5 O
times O
and O
i O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great B-OP
time I-OP
there O
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
great B-OP
and O
reasonably B-OP
priced I-OP
. O

i O
have O
tried O
to O
make O
reservations O
, O
but O
both O
times O
, O
the O
hostess B-AS
did O
n O
' O
t O
have O
my O
name O
. O

if O
the O
weather O
is O
nice O
, O
try O
to O
snag O
an O
outside B-AS
table I-AS
. O

the O
staff B-AS
has O
been O
nice B-OP
, O
but O
they O
seemed O
really O
stressed B-OP
and O
the O
unisex B-AS
bathroom I-AS
needs O
to O
be O
cleaned O
more O
often O
. O

my O
boyfriend O
and O
i O
went O
there O
to O
celebrate O
my O
birthday O
the O
other O
night O
and O
all O
i O
can O
say O
is O
that O
it O
was O
magnificent B-OP
. O

from O
the O
spectacular B-OP
caviar B-AS
to O
the O
hospitable B-OP
waitstaff B-AS
, O
i O
felt O
like O
royalty O
and O
enjoyed O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

considering O
we O
were O
the O
last O
patrons O
there O
and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
closing O
time O
, O
the O
waitstaff B-AS
did O
not O
rush O
us O
at O
all O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
comfortable B-OP
and O
relaxed B-OP
. O

i O
highly O
recommend O
caviar O
russe O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
delicious B-OP
top I-OP
grade I-OP
caviar B-AS
and O
fantastic B-OP
service B-AS
. O

nice O

owned O
traditional B-OP
restaurant B-AS
. O

i O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised B-OP
to O
find O
this O
gem O
in O
hoboken O
. O

i O
found O
the O
food B-AS
to O
be O
outstanding B-OP
, O
particulary O
the O
salmon B-AS
dish I-AS
i O
had O
. O

i O
also O
ordered O
the O
change B-AS
mojito I-AS
, O
which O
was O
out B-OP
of I-OP
this I-OP
world I-OP
. O

my O
friends O
settled O
for O
rice O
dishes O
, O
but O
we O
came O
back O
the O
following O
day O
to O
try O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
which O
was O
good B-OP
. O
. O
. O
not B-OP
outstanding I-OP
, O
but O
good B-OP
. O

we O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-AS
patio I-AS
, O
which O
is O
worth B-OP
it O
as O
it O
' O
s O
cool B-OP
and O
the O
music B-AS
is O
hear O
well B-OP
there O
. O

overall O
, O
excellent B-OP
restaurant B-AS
! O

the O
food B-AS
was O
good B-OP
. O

the O
place B-AS
was O
nice B-OP
and O
calm B-OP
. O

but O
the O
service B-AS
was O
a O
bit O
slow B-OP
. O

the O
buffet B-AS
had O
a O
nice B-OP
selection O
. O

the O
food B-AS
was O
average B-OP
or I-OP
above I-OP
including O
some O
surprising B-OP
tasty B-OP
dishes B-AS
. O

service B-AS
was O
also O
very O
good B-OP
. O

i O
would O
go O
back O
. O

i O
got O
an O
excellent B-OP
piece O
of O
cheesecake B-AS
and O
we O
had O
several O
other O
nice B-OP
pastries B-AS
. O

i O
would O
recommend B-OP
roxy O
' O
s O
for O
that O
, O
but O
not O
for O
their O
food B-AS
. O

my O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-AS
and O
they O
were O
huge B-OP
! O

but O
, O
they O
were O
too B-OP
big I-OP
for O
the O
bun O
. O

consequently O
, O
their O
burgers B-AS
fell B-OP
apart I-OP
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did O
' O
nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

also O
they O
were O
$ O
15 O
each O
! O

i O
had O
a O
huge B-OP
pastrami B-AS
sandwich I-AS
on I-AS
a I-AS
roll I-AS
. O

it O
was O
$ O
14 O
not B-OP
really I-OP
bad I-OP
for O
a O
pound O
of O
pastrami O
- O
but O
it O
did O
n O
' O
t O
have O
much O
taste O
- O
i O
' O
ve O
had O
better O
for O
less O
elsewhere O
! O

this O
place B-AS
is O
really O
trendi B-OP
but O
they O
have O
forgotten B-OP
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food B-AS
. O

the O
last O
two O
times O
i O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-AS
was O
soo O
spicy B-OP
that O
i O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice B-AS
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

and O
the O
tom B-AS
kha I-AS
soup I-AS
was O
pathetic B-OP
. O

if O
you O
want O
good B-OP
authentic B-OP
thai B-AS
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

went O
here O
for O

couple O
of O
weeks O
ago O
on O

, O
thin O
- O
crust O
pizza O
with O
a O
nice B-OP
amount O
of O
spicy B-AS
italian I-AS
cheese I-AS
that O

were O
the O
best B-OP
he O
has O
had O
. O

we O
had O
the O

the O

it O
. O

by O
far O
, O
the O
best B-OP
pizza B-AS
in O
manhattan O
. O

the O
crust B-AS
is O
thin B-OP

the O
menu B-AS
has O
so O
many O
fish O
items O
and O
oysters O
. O

the O
fish B-AS
was O
really O
, O
really O
fresh B-OP
. O

we O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
seafood O
restaurants O
in O
new O
york O
. O

i O
stumbled O
upon O
this O
great B-OP
pizzeria B-AS

i O
explored O
my O
new O
neighborhood O
. O

all O
of O
the O
pizzas B-AS

the O
sophia B-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

it O
' O
s O
to O
die O
for O
! O

the O
food B-AS
was O
mediocre B-OP
at O
best O
but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible B-OP
service B-AS
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

immediately O
after O
we O
paid O
, O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
the O
money O
and O
said O
, O
okay O
, O
you O
guys O
are O
outta O
here O
. O

so O
rushing O
us O
out O
was O
absolutely O
unnecessary O
! O

for O
the O
people O
who O
want O
great B-OP
food B-AS
plus O
great B-OP
service B-AS

a O
final O
judgement O

this O
tiny O

always O
pleasantly O
surprising B-OP
. O

the O
pizza B-AS

delicious B-OP
and O
the O
proprietor B-AS
is O
one O
of O
the O
nicest B-OP
in O
nyc O
. O

they O
even O
scoop O
it O
out O
nice B-OP
( O
for O
those O
on O

a O
little O
crowded O
but O
they O
move O
that O

really O
fast B-OP

any O
special O
requests O

i O
asked O
for O
an O
open O

the O

told O
me O
to O
take O

be O
sure O
not O
to O
get O
anything O
other O
than O
bagels B-AS

the O
worst B-OP
excuse O
for O
japanese O
food O
i O
' O
ve O
ever O
encountered O
. O

the O
soup B-AS
for I-AS
the I-AS
udon I-AS
was O
soy O

water O
. O

the O
sushi B-AS
was O
awful B-OP
! O

the O
rice B-AS
was O
poor B-OP
quality I-OP
and O
was O
cooked B-OP
so I-OP
badly I-OP
it O
was O
hard B-OP
. O

furthermore O
, O
the O
rice B-AS
had O
no O
seasoning O
, O
so O
the O
sushi B-AS
was O
bland B-OP
and O
disgusting B-OP
. O

the O
fish B-AS
was O
adequate B-OP
, O
but O
inexpertly B-OP
sliced I-OP
. O

it O
is O
obvious O
that O
no O
one O
in O
the O
restaurant O
has O
any O
idea O
about O
or O
experience O
with O
japanese B-AS
cuisine I-AS
. O

the O

changed O
and O
it O
was O
not B-OP
for I-OP
the I-OP
better I-OP
. O

i O
wish O
they O
would O
change O
back O
to O
what O
it O
was O
before O
. O

the O
food B-AS
now O
is O
inconsistent B-OP
. O

this O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-AS
you O
' O
d O
like B-OP
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

the O
setting B-AS
is O
casual B-OP
and O
romantic B-OP
. O

prices O
are O
very O
good B-OP
. O

the O
food B-AS
is O
excellent B-OP

if O

, O
try B-OP
the O
balsamic B-AS

it O
' O
s O
wonderful B-OP
! O

they O
were O
such O
a O
rip B-OP

off I-OP
( O
$ O
8 O
. O
95 O
for O
four O
small B-OP
meat O
patties O
in O

) O
and O
not B-OP
worth I-OP
trying O
. O

the O
rest O
of O
the O
dim B-AS
sum I-AS
, O
though O
pricey B-OP
by O
chinatown O
standards O
, O
is O
worth B-OP
it O
. O

the O
wait B-AS
here O
is O
long B-OP
for O
dim O
sum O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
n O
' O
t O
like O
sharing O
tables O
or O
if O
the O
typical O
raucous O
dim O
sum O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
not O
your O
gig O
, O
this O
is O
a O
sleek O
( O
for O
chinatown O
) O
alternative O
. O

a O
few O
tips O
: O
skip B-OP
the O
turnip B-AS
cake I-AS
, O
roast B-AS
pork I-AS
buns I-AS
and O
egg B-AS
custards I-AS
. O

these O
are O
overpriced B-OP
and O
you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O
the O
corner O
: O

i O
was O
pleasantly B-OP
suprised B-OP
. O

the O
food B-AS
was O
exceptional B-OP
. O

i O
choose O
to O
go O
with O
one O
of O
the O
special O
, O
the O
braised B-AS
lamb I-AS
shank I-AS
in I-AS
red I-AS
wine I-AS
, O
which O
was O
excellent B-OP
. O

the O
service B-AS
was O
friendly B-OP
and O
the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
casual B-OP
. O

the O
restaurant B-AS
is O
a O
bit O
noisy B-OP
but O
that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O
and O
enjoy B-OP
a O
great B-OP
meal B-AS

this O
little B-OP
place B-AS
has O
a O
cute B-OP
interior B-AS
decor I-AS
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

the O
pad B-AS
se I-AS
ew I-AS
chicken I-AS
was O
delicious B-OP
, O
however O
the O
pad B-AS
thai I-AS
was O
far O
too O
oily B-OP
. O

have O
eaten O
at O
ginger B-AS
house I-AS
several O
times O
, O
and O
it O
' O
s O
always O
good B-OP
. O

the O
fried B-AS
dumplings I-AS
are O
great B-OP
! O

finally O
a O
reliable B-OP
chinese B-AS
restaurant I-AS
! O

this O
place O
would O
be O
so O
much O
better O
served O
by O
being O
run O
by O
a O
group O
that O
actually O
understands O
customer B-AS
service I-AS
. O

the O
only O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
here O
is O
walk O
in O
and O
eat O
. O
. O
but O
planning O
an O
event O
, O
especially O
a O
small O
, O
intimate O
one O
, O
forget O
about O
it O
. O

they O
are O
not B-OP
helpful I-OP
in O
the O
least O
and O
will O
give O
you O
the O
grand O
run O
around O
so O
by O
the O
time O
the O
event O
date O
rolls O
around O
you O
will O
not O
only O
regret O
chosing O
this O
place O
, O
but O
also O
become O
hostile O
! O

nobody O
at O
this O
restaurant O
will O
give O
firm O
answers O
about O
anything O
and O
in O
the O
end O
, O
not O
one O
person O
takes O
responsibility O
for O
anything O
. O

terrible B-OP
, O
terrible B-OP

though O
a O

only O
drawback O
- O
they O

your O

, O
and O
they O
do O
n O
' O
t O

that O
is O

it O

the O

the O

, O
well O
, O
it O
' O
s O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
i O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying B-OP
. O

if O
celebrities O
make O
you O
sweat O
, O
then O
your O
in O
for O
a O
ride O
, O
but O
if O
your O
like O
most O
around O
these O
parts O
then O
you O
' O
ll O
just O
yawn O
and O
wonder O
whats O
with O
all O
the O
hype O
. O

rao B-AS
is O
a O
good B-OP
restaurant O
, O
but O
it O
' O

the O

the O
` O
` O

' O
' O
appetizer B-AS
of I-AS
olives I-AS
was O
disappointing B-OP

however O
, O
our O
main B-AS
course I-AS
was O
wonderful B-OP
. O

i O
had O
fish B-AS
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet B-AS
- O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded B-OP
our I-OP
expectations I-OP
. O

the O
dessert O
( O
we O
had O
a O
pear B-AS
torte I-AS
) O
was O
good B-OP
- O
but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff B-AS
was O
unable B-OP
to I-OP
provide I-OP
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
. O

when O
we O
inquired O
about O
ports O
- O
the O
waitress B-AS
listed O
off O
several O
but O
did O
not O
know O
taste O
variations O
or O
cost O
. O

all O
in O
all O
, O
i O
would O
return O
- O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful B-OP
restaurant B-AS
- O
but O
i O
hope O
the O
staff B-AS
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
. O

short B-OP
and O
sweet B-OP
– O
seating B-AS
is O
great B-OP
: O
it O
' O
s O
romantic B-OP
, O
cozy B-OP
and O
private B-OP
. O

the O

are O
not B-OP
as I-OP
small I-OP
as O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
make O
them O
out O
to O
look O
they O
' O
re O
perfect B-OP
for O
2 O
people O

the O
service B-AS
was O
extremely O
fast B-OP
and O
attentive B-OP
( O
thanks B-OP
to I-OP
the O
service B-AS
button I-AS
on O
your O

but O
i O
barely O
understood O
1 O
word O
when O
the O
waiter B-AS
took O
our O
order O
. O

over O
all O
the O
looks B-AS
of O
the O
place O
exceeds B-OP
the O
actual O
meals B-AS
. O

so O
what O
you O
really O
end O
up O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
restaurant B-AS
not O
the O
food B-AS
. O

will O
prob O
. O
not O
return O
but O
it O
is O
a O

a O
good B-OP

nothing O
but O
a O
great B-OP
time O
! O

highly O
recommended B-OP
! O

one O
of O
the O
best B-OP
, O
if O
not O
the O
best O
, O
restaurants O
in O
park O
slope O
( O
and O
ny O
in O
general O
) O

everything O
on O
the O
menu B-AS
is O
great B-OP
. O

this O
establishment B-AS
is O
the O
real B-OP
deal I-OP
. O

wish O
ny O
had O
more O
of O
these O
kind O
of O
places O
: O
intimate B-OP
, O
superb B-OP
food B-AS
, O
homey B-OP
, O
top B-OP
notch I-OP
all O
the O
way O
around O
, O
certainly O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

but O
$ O
500 O
for O
a O
dinner B-AS
for I-AS
two I-AS
that O
did O
n O
' O
t O
include O
wine O
? O

look O
, O
the O
appetizers B-AS
were O
really O
good B-OP
. O

the O
entree B-AS
was O
also O
very O
good B-OP
. O

ca O
n O
' O
t O
argue O
about O
that O
, O
but O
they O
are O
clearly O
over B-OP
priced I-OP
. O

what O
you O
are O
paying O
for O
is O
the O
environment B-AS
and O
the O
name O
. O

yes O
, O
the O
place B-AS
is O
classy B-OP
and O
beautiful B-OP
, O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
. O

which O
of O
course O
is O
not O
real O
kobe O
but O
wagyu O
beef O
. O

surprised O
that O
a O
place O
of O
this O
caliber O
would O
advertise O
it O
as O
kobe O
. O

vanison B-AS
was O
good B-OP
but O
not B-OP
amazing I-OP
. O

bison B-AS
was O
quite O
excellent B-OP
however O
. O

dessert B-AS
: O
pure O
disaster B-OP
. O

just O
not B-OP
good I-OP
at O
all O
. O

some O
pineapple O
covered O
in O
a O
glaze O
of O
some O
kind O
and O
some O
pear O
tart O
thing O
not B-OP
impressive I-OP
at O
all O
. O

i O
read O
reviews O
that O
called O
the O
restaurant B-AS
too O
expensive B-OP
and O
i O
thought O
to O
myself O
, O
but O
may O
be O
it O
is O
worth O
it O
. O

the B-AS
four I-AS
seasons I-AS
has O
history O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
landmark O
of O
new O
york O
city O
restaurants O
, O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
they O
will O
charge O
you O
through O
the O
nose O
just O
so O
that O
you O
can O
say O
` O
` O
i O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
the O
four O
seasons O
restaurant O
' O
' O
. O

all O
in O
all O
, O
the O
food B-AS
was O
great B-OP
( O
except B-OP
for O
the O
dessserts B-AS
) O
. O

if O
you O
are O
going O
for O
the O
food B-AS
, O
it O
will O
not O
be O
worth B-OP
it O
. O

you O
would O
think O
they O
would O
make O
up O
for O
it O
with O
service B-AS
, O
sadly B-OP
, O
no O
. O

service B-AS
was O
just O
ok B-OP
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
' O
d O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O
. O

terrible B-OP
waste O
of O
money O
. O
. O
scammers B-OP

i O
agree O
that O
dining O
at O
casa B-AS
la I-AS
femme I-AS
is O
like O
no O
other O
dining O
experience O
! O

i O
am O
actually O
offended B-OP
to O
have O
spent O
so O
much O
money O
on O
such O
a O
bad B-OP
experience O
. O

i O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
casa B-AS
la I-AS
femme I-AS
and O
was O
so O
offended B-OP
by O
my O
visit O
felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O
and O
time O
. O

our O
visit O
their O
to O
say O
the O
least O
, O
was O
an O
unpleasant B-OP
and O
costly B-OP
experience O
! O

and O
even O
more O
so O
unpleasant B-OP
because O
it O
was O
so O
costly B-OP
for O
such O
an O
unpleasant B-OP
experience O
. O

we O
did O
arrive O
late O
for O
our O
reservation O
so O
i O
can O
not O
complain O
too O
much O
about O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
. O

although O
we O
were O
told O
10 O
- O
15 O
minutes O
and O
it O
was O
more O
like O
45 O
minutes O
. O

we O
were O
ushered O
to O
the O
bar O
to O
wait O
momentarily O
and O
upon O
arrival O
were O
so O
excited B-OP
. O

the O
place B-AS
is O
beautiful B-OP
! O

the O
hostess B-AS
was O
very O
pleasant B-OP
. O

our O
experience O
did O
not O
ever O
get O
any O
better O
. O

for O
each O
course O
we O
waited O
over O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hour O
to O
45 O
minutes O
and O
were O
never O
offered O
a O
drink O
. O

we O
also O
asked O
for O
hooka O
six O
times O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
kept O
telling O
us O
one O
minute O
and O
never O
returning O
with O
the O
hooka O
. O

after O
the O
4th O
time O
i O
asked O
again O
and O
the O
waiter B-AS
than O
said O
after O
our O
dinner O
. O

we O
asked O
for O
beverages O
and O
never O
received O
them O
. O

we O
asked O
for O
sides O
which O
the O
waiter B-AS
than O
admitted O
that O
he O
forgot B-OP
to O
put O
in O
that O
part O
of O
our O
order O
. O

my O
chicken B-AS
was O
inedible B-OP
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
. O

i O
would O
not O
expect O
this O
for O
a O
$ O
55 O
dinner B-AS
. O

by O
the O
time O
we O
finished O
our O
dinner O
we O
still O
had O
not O
received O
one O
beverage O
nor O
hooka O
! O

what O
we O
did O
do O
was O
waste O
3 O
hours O
being O
trapped O
in O
a O
table O
waiting O
and O
waiting O
for O
food O
and O
drinks O
and O
hooka O
. O
. O
some O
of O
which O
we O
never O
received O
! O

the O
only O
beverage O
we O
did O
receive O
was O
water O
in O
dirty B-OP
glasses O
! O

to O
top O
it O
all O
off O
. O
. O
the O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
to O
your O
restaurant O
was O
for O
the O
belly O
dancers O
and O
missed O
the O
first O
show O
as O
we O
were O
not O
seated O
yet O
and O
the O
2nd O
belly O
dancer O
only O
danced O
at O
two O
tables O
in O
the O
back O
of O
the O
restaurant O
and O
never O
made O
it O
around O
to O
the O
other O
half O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

by O
the O
time O
we O
left O
our O
wallets O
were O
empty O
and O
so O
were O
our O
stomachs O
and O
we O
missed O
the O
show O
we O
were O
supposed O
to O
see O
following O
our O
dinner O
, O
which O
would O
have O
been O
acceptable O
if O
we O
got O
to O
enjoy O
the O
experience O
of O
good O
food O
and O
belly O
dancers O
! O

if O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
i O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal B-AS
was O
inedible B-OP
! O

i O
have O
never O
left O
a O
restaurant B-AS
feeling O
as O
if O
i O
was O
abused B-OP
, O
and O
wasted O
my O
hard O
earned O
money O
. O

my O
husbands O
birthday O
and O
my O
sons O
was O
not O
as O
it O
was O
intended O
. O
. O
. O
and O
we O
drove O
two O
hours O
to O
spend O
too O
much O
money O
to O
be O
treated O
terribly B-OP
! O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
be O
refunded O
! O

do O
n O
' O
t O
go O
with O
a O
larger O
group O
than O
4 O
! O

at O
first O
we O
were O
a O
little O
taken O
aback O
, O
as O
this O
seemed O
to O
present O
a O
problem O
, O
although O
the O
restaurant O
looked O
fairly O
empty O
, O
but O
they O
hastily O
put O
the O
table O
together O
for O
us O
. O

the O
menu B-AS
is O
fairly O
simple B-OP
without O
much O
descriptions O
. O

there O
was O
no O
tap O
beer B-AS
that O
evening O
, O
which O
was O
a O
disappointment B-OP
. O

not B-OP
much I-OP
of O
a O
selection B-AS
of I-AS
bottled I-AS
beer I-AS
either O
, O
we O
went O
with O
brahma O
. O

the O
appetizers O
we O
ordered O
were O
served O
quickly B-OP
- O
an O
order O
of O
fried B-AS
oysters I-AS
and I-AS
clams I-AS
were O
delicious B-OP
but O
a O
tiny B-OP
portion O
( O
maybe O
3 O
of O
each O
) O
. O

the O
lobster B-AS
knuckles I-AS
( O
special O
of O
the O
day O
) O
were O
ok B-OP
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless B-OP
. O

i O
believe O
there O
were O
2 O
shrimp O
in O
the O
` B-AS
` I-AS
salt I-AS
encrusted I-AS
shrimp I-AS
' I-AS
' I-AS
appetizer I-AS
. O

she O
replied O
` O
` O
well O
it O
would O
be O
more O
convenient O
for O
us O
if O
you O
ordered O
now O
, O
since O
you O
are O
a O
larger O
party O
, O
and O
it O
might O
get O
crowded O
. O
' O
' O

the O
food O
arrived O
in O
about O
15 O
minutes O
. O

i O
had O
the O
thai B-AS
style I-AS
fried I-AS
sea I-AS
bass I-AS
. O
. O
. O
which O
was O
very O
good B-OP
. O

everyone O
seemed O
generally O
happy B-OP
with O
their O
food B-AS
, O
except O
my O
brother O
who O
had O
the O
grilled B-AS
mahi I-AS
mahi I-AS
, O
seemingly O
drenched O
in O
grapfruit O
juice O
! O

i O
heard O
the O
lobster B-AS
roll I-AS
was O
excellent B-OP
. O

they O
seemed O
to O
continue O
to O
rush O
us O
along O
, O
taking O
plates O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
( O
my O
sister O
still O
had O
her O
fork O
in O
hand O
) O
. O

all O
in O
all O
the O
food B-AS
was O
good B-OP
- O
a O
little O
on O
the O
expensive B-OP
side O
, O
but O
fresh B-OP
. O

service B-AS
not B-OP
the I-OP
friendliest I-OP
to O
our O
` O
` O
large O
party O
' O
' O
! O

probably O
would O
not O
go O
back O
here O

wretched B-OP
and O
retching B-OP

i O
have O
never O
been O
so O
disgusted B-OP
by O
both O
food B-AS
an O
service B-AS
. O

for O
starters O
they O
delivered O
us O
someone O
else O
' O

however O
, O
once O
i O
received O
my O
predictably O
mediocre B-OP
order O
of O
what O
dokebi O
thinks O
passes O
as O
korean B-AS
fair I-AS
, O
( O
sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
settle O
when O
it O
' O
s O
your O
only O
option O
) O
, O
i O
got O
through O
about O
half O
my O
kimchee B-AS
before O
i O
found O
a O
piece O
of O
random O
lettuce O
accompanied O
by O
a O
far O
more O
disgusting B-OP
, O
slimy B-OP
, O
clearly O
bad B-OP
piece O
of O
fish O
skin O
. O

my O
main O
concern O
was O
the O
sanity O
of O
the O
food B-AS
that O
was O
being O
sent O
out O
to O
myself O
and O
others O
, O
but O
i O
would O
be O
lying O
is O
i O
said O
that O
as O
someone O
who O
has O
worked O
in O
restaurants O
since O
the O
age O
of O
fifteen O
i O
was O
expecting O
at O
least O
a O
minimal O
effort O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
amend O
the O
situation O
. O

none O
was O
made O
so O
i O
hung O
up O
. O

less O
than O
three O
minutes O
passed O
before O
i O
found O
myself O
doubled O
over O
the O
toilet O
. O

my O
girlfriend O
, O
being O
slightly O
more O
aggressive O
, O
and O
having O
been O
equally O
disgusted B-OP
causing O
her O
to O
throw O
out O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
barely O
eaten O
meal B-AS
, O
called O
back O
only O
to O
be O
informed O
that O
i O
was O
probably O
wrong O
and O
that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O
, O
and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O
their O
restaurant O
. O

it O
was O
n O
' O
t O
as O
if O
this O
restaurant B-AS
had O
any O
major O
bragging O

now O
it O

a O
quintessential B-OP
slice B-AS
of I-AS
nyc I-AS
pizza I-AS
. O

the O
crust B-AS
has O
a O
great B-OP
bite O
and O
a O
good B-OP
chew O
, O
the O
sauce B-AS
is O
light B-OP
with O
a O
nice B-OP
acidity O
to O
it O
, O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese B-AS
is O
great B-OP

really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O
other O
components O
. O

personally O
i O
like B-OP
the O
margherita B-AS

better O
, O

they O
are O
all O
good B-OP
. O

possibly O
the O
most O
romantic B-OP
restaurant B-AS
in O

this O
is O
undoubtedly O
my O
favorite B-OP
modern B-AS
japanese I-AS
brasserie I-AS
( O
that O

, O
and O
in O

opinion O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic B-OP
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
! O

not O
only O
is O
it O
an O
adventure O
getting O
to O
this O
somewhat O
hidden B-OP
spot B-AS
, O
once O
you O
enter O
the O
unmarked B-AS
wooden I-AS

, O
the O
zen O
and O
intimate B-OP

such O

we O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful B-OP

i O
picked O
the O
grilled B-AS

cod I-AS
as O
my O
entree O
, O
which O
i O
absolutely O
devoured B-OP
while O
someone O
commented O
that O
the O
grilled B-AS

was O
better B-OP
. O

the O
entrees B-AS
were O
served O
with O

we O
tried O
the O

) O

' O

more O

a O
quiet B-OP

terrible B-OP
would O
be O
a O
compliment O
! O

the O
service B-AS
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
from O
feeling O
like O

we O
paid O

but O
got O
nothing O

the O

the O

the O

restaurant O
with O
a O

the O
food B-AS
tasted O
very O
good B-OP
. O

the O
main B-AS
entree I-AS
was O
also O
very O
good B-OP
. O

price O
is O
high B-OP
but O
the O
food B-AS
is O
good B-OP
, O
so O
i O
would O
come O
back O

. O

this O
place B-AS
does O
n O
' O
t O
make O
any O
sense O

just O
want O
to O
warn O
you O
all O
- O
do O
n O
' O
t O
waste O
your O
time O
and O
money O
. O

this O
place O
has O
totally O
weird B-OP
decor B-AS
, O
stairs O
going O
up O
with O
mirrored O
walls O
- O
i O
am O
surprised O
how O
no O
one O
yet O
broke O
their O
head O
or O
fall O
off O
the O
stairs O
- O
mirrored B-AS
walls I-AS
make O
you O
dizzy B-OP
and O
delusional B-OP
. O
. O
. O

this O
place B-AS
is O
not B-OP
inviting I-OP
and O
the O
food B-AS
is O
totally O
weird B-OP
. O

the O
concept O
of O
japanese B-AS
tapas I-AS
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
does B-OP
n I-OP
' I-OP
t I-OP
work I-OP
. O

good B-OP
food B-AS

the O
food B-AS
was O
great B-OP
and O
tasty B-OP
, O
but O
the O
sitting B-AS
space I-AS
was O
too B-OP
small I-OP
, O
i O
do O
n O
' O
t O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

over O
all O
it O
was O
a O
very O
nice B-OP
romantic B-OP
place B-AS
. O

loved B-OP
it O

a O
coworker O
and O
i O
tried O
pacifico B-AS
after O
work O
a O
few O
fridays O
and O
loved B-OP
it O
. O

the O
atmosphere B-AS
was O
great B-OP
. O

the O
food B-AS
we O
ordered O
was O
excellent B-OP
, O
although O
i O
would O
n O
' O
t O
say O
the O
margaritas B-AS
were O
anything O
to O
write O
home O
about O
. O

our O
waitress B-AS
was O
n B-OP
' I-OP
t I-OP
mean I-OP
, O
but O
not B-OP
especially I-OP
warm I-OP
or I-OP
attentive I-OP
either O
. O

i O
must O
say O
i O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad B-OP
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant B-AS
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
, O
though O
. O

regardless O
, O
we O
' O
ll O
be O
back O
and O
ca O
n O
' O
t O
wait O
to O
visit O
in O
the O
summer O
to O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
patio B-AS
. O

dumbfoundingly O
poor B-OP

this O
was O
, O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
, O
a O
mind O
- O
bogglingly O
uncomfortable B-OP
experience O
. O

lexicographers O
take O
note O
: O
a O
new O
and O
fascinating O
definition O
of O
rudeness B-OP
is O
alive O
and O
flourishing O
right O
here O
in O
brooklyn O
. O

the O
servers B-AS
at O
flatbush O
farm O
appear O
to O
have O
perfected B-OP
that O
ghastly O
technique O
of O
making O
you O
feel O
guilty O
and O
ashamed O
for O
deigning O
to O
attract O
their O
attention O
. O

polite O
acknowledgement O
is O
out O
; O

and O
how O
many O
times O
can O
you O
pick O
up O
the O
same O
perfectly O
aligned O
set O
of O
napkins O
, O
inspect O
them O
vapidly O
and O
plonk O
them O
down O
in O
exactly O
the O
same O
place O
instead O
of O
venturing O
a O
glance O
at O
people O
who O
are O
there O
to O
help O
you O
make O
the O
rent O
? O

a O
different O
server B-AS
enhanced B-OP
the O
fun O
, O
dumping O
our O
entrees O
in O
front O
of O
us O
halfway O
through O
our O
appetizer B-AS
( O
which O
was O
delicious B-OP
) O
. O

overall O
the O
food B-AS
quality O
was O
pretty O
good B-OP
, O
though O
i O
hear O
the O
salmon O
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
has O
n O
' O
t O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O

the O

a O
nice B-OP
fit B-AS

out I-AS

some O
attractive B-OP

and O
, O
from O
what O
i O
could O
tell O

a O
reasonable B-OP

list I-AS
( O
i O
was O

at O

on O

it O
' O

a O

how O
is O
this O
palce B-AS
still O
open O
? O

i O
honestly O
do O
n O
' O
t O
even O
know O
where O
to O
begin O
. O

we O
arrived O
and O
were O
seated O
immediately O
, O
which O
made O
us O
both O
happy B-OP
. O

everything O
was O
going O
good B-OP
until O
we O
got O
our O
meals B-AS
. O

i O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-AS
and O
i O
was O
appalled B-OP
. O

it O
was O
served O
with O
skin O
, O
over O
a O
bed O
of O
extremely O
undercooked B-OP
spinach B-AS
and O
mashed O
potatoes O
. O

i O
took O
one O
bite O
from O
the O
$ O
24 O
salmon B-AS
, O
and O
i O
have O
never O
, O
in O
the O
17 O
years O
i O
have O
been O
going O
to O
restaurants O
tasted O
salmon O
as O
fishy B-OP
, O
as O
dry B-OP
, O
and O
as O
bland B-OP
as O
the O
one O
in O
flatbush O
farms O
. O

at O
this O
point O
, O
the O
waitress B-AS
comes O
over O
and O
asks O
us O
if O
everything O
was O
okay O
, O
i O
was O
literally O
so O
shocked O
that O
i O
was O
speechless O
and O
did O
n O
' O
t O
say O
anything O
, O
and O
guess O
what O
, O
the O
waitress O
walked O
away O
. O

so O
, O
i O
switch O
with O
my O
boyfriend O
again O
to O
see O
if O
maybe O
i O
could O
stomach O
the O
meat O
and O
spinach O
again O
, O
but O
the O
spinach B-AS
was O
so O
undercooked B-OP
that O
i O
just O
could O
not O
bite O
through O
it O
. O

i O
could O
n O
' O
t O
even O
enjoy O
the O
mashed O
potatoes O
because O
it O
was O
hidden O
completely O
under O
the O
chicken O
and O
spinach O
. O

so O
i O
decide O
to O
report O
back O
to O
the O
waitress O
because O
it O
was O
completely O
inedible B-OP
. O

guess O
what O
, O
i O
waited O
for O
twenty O
minutes O
before O
she O
came O
over O
and O
when O
she O
finally O
did O
, O
she O
says O
, O
` O
` O
oh O
well O
, O
i O
wish O
you O
would O
have O
said O
something O
earlier O
' O
' O
no O
apology O
, O
nothing B-OP

after O
that O
she O
simply O
took O
our O
plates O
, O
walked O
away O
, O
came O
back O
another O
twenty O
minutes O
later O
with O
the O

the O

the O

i O
was O
almost O
amused O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
was O
turning O
away O
customers O
at O
9pm O
on O
a O
friday O
night O
because O
she O
` O
` O
had O
a O
bbq O
to O
go O
to O
' O
' O
that O
night O
- O
wtf O
? O
? O

i O
' O
d O
be O
horrified B-OP
if O
my O

turning O
away O

so O
early O
and O
so O
rudely O
! O

there O
' O
s O
another O
girl B-AS
who O
i O
ca O
n O
' O
t O
describe O
, O
she O
is O
about O
5 O
' O
6 O
' O
' O
with O
brown O
hair O
, O
who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O
conversation O
and O
chimes O
in O
- O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
, O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you O
' O
re O
* O
really O
* O
talking O
about O
. O

i O
' O
m O
a O
friendly O
person O
, O
so O
i O
would O

' O
t O

had O
she O
not O
been O
so O
nasty B-OP
and O
gotten O
so O
personal O
. O

again O
, O
i O
' O
d O
be O
super O
upset B-OP
if O
that O

my O
employee O

considering O
you O
will O
spend O
at O

$ O
60 O
a O
head O
, O
i O
expect B-OP
better I-OP

so O
, O
if O
you O

the O

even O
better B-OP

everyone O
must O
come O
here O
at O

taking O
hot B-AS
dogs I-AS
to O
the O
next O
level O

at O
first O
glance O
this O
place O
seems O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
a O
hot B-AS
dog I-AS

, O
but O
at O
bark B-AS
you O
do O
n O
' O
t O
just O
get O
your O
average O
hot O

here O
the O
hot B-AS

is O
elevated B-OP

the O
level O
of O
a O

numerous B-OP
variations O

great B-OP

atmosphere B-AS

the O

but O
needs O
a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
. O

poor B-OP
service B-AS
and O
management B-AS

had O
an O
awful B-OP
experience O
at O
casa B-AS
la I-AS
femme I-AS
on O
a O
saturday O
dinner O
. O

appetizers O
took O
nearly O
an O
hour O
. O

never O
got O
an O
explanation O
as O
to O
what O
was O
going O
on O
. O

the O
manager B-AS
was O
rude B-OP
and O
handled O
the O
situation O
extremely O
poorly B-OP
. O

on O
the O
way O
out O
, O
we O
heard O
of O
other O
guests O
complaining B-OP
about O
similar O
issues O
. O

can O
’ O
t O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive B-OP
nyc O
restaurant B-AS
can O
be O
so O
disrespectful B-OP
to O
its O
clients O
. O

what O
a O
hassle B-OP
! O

the O
food B-AS
is O
very O
good B-OP
, O
but O
not B-OP
outstanding I-OP
. O

there O
is O
no O
way O
it O
justifies O
the O
accolades O
it O
receives O
, O
the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staff B-AS
or O
the O
wait B-AS
for O
a O
table O
. O

on O
our O
last O
visit O
, O
they O
skipped O
over O
our O
name O
on O
the O
list O
, O
leaving O
us O
waiting O
an O
extra O
hour O
for O
a O
table O
. O

mistakes O
happen O
, O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
accompanied O
by O
an O
apology O
, O
perhaps O
even O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
. O
. O
. O
but O
not O
the O
grunt O
that O
we O
received O
from O
the O
al O
di O
la O
staff B-AS
. O

expensive B-OP

the O
pasta B-AS
was O
well B-OP
cooked I-OP
, O
did O
n O
' O
t O
have O
enough O
sauce O
though O
or O
flavor O
. O

so O
rude B-OP
! O
! O
! O

i O
was O
one O
of O
the O
people O
that O
went O
for O
this O
horrible B-OP
experience O
. O

the O
hostess B-AS
was O
rude B-OP
and O
i O
got O
a O
distinct O
feeling O
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
serve O
us O
. O

the O
only O
thing O
that O
my O
friend O
left O
out O
is O
that O
when O
we O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
bar O
the O
bartender B-AS
disappeared B-OP
. O

i O
asked O
for O
a O
menu O
and O
the O
same O
waitress B-AS
looked O
at O
my O
like O
i O
was O
insane O
. O

i O
was O
shocked O
that O
my O
friends O
wanted O
to O
stay O
after O
the O
waitress B-AS
said O
, O
` O
` O
can O
i O
help O
you O
' O
' O
and O
` O
` O
how O
many O
are O
in O
your O
party O
. O
' O
' O

the O
three O
of O
us O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
her O
should O
have O
been O
an O
indication O
of O
how O
many O
of O
us O
there O
were O
. O

we O
did O
n O
' O
t O
look O
like O
the O
other O
patrons O
in O
there O
so O
unfortunately O
i O
think O
that O
may O
have O
been O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
. O

bad B-OP
staff B-AS

i O
generally O
like B-OP
this O
place B-AS
. O

the O
design O
of O
the O
space B-AS
is O
good B-OP
. O

but O
the O
service B-AS
is O
horrid B-OP
! O

i O
was O
there O
for O
brunch O
recently O
, O
and O
we O
were O
tag O
teamed B-OP
by O
a O
waitress B-AS
and O
a O
waiter B-AS
. O

the O
waiter B-AS
delivered O
our O
food O
while O
holding O
what O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
plastic O
bag O
of O
garbage O
in O
one O
hand O
. O

i O
ca O
n O
' O
t O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
, O
but O
please O
put O
the O
bag O
down O
before O
delivering O
food O
! O

the O
waitress B-AS
came O
to O
check O
in O
on O
us O
every O
few O
minutes O
, O
and O
began O
to O
clear O
the O
plates O
while O
half O
of O
us O
were O
still O
eating O
( O
a O
big O
pet O
peeve O
of O
mine O
that O
happens O
almost O
everywhere O
, O
so O
i O
try O
to O
ignore O
it O
) O
. O

i O
could O
n O
' O
t O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
reach O
over O
the O
plate O
of O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
, O
who O
was O
in O
mid O
bite O
, O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
. O

she O
then O
put O
the O
check O
down O
without O
asking O
if O
we O
were O
done O
, O
and O
came O
to O
check O
on O
the O
bill O
every O
two O
minutes O
, O
even O
though O
we O
were O
one O
of O
three O
occupied O
tables O
. O

i O
wish O
i O
could O
like O
this O
place B-AS
more O
, O
and O
i O
wish O
someone O
would O
retrain O
the O
staff B-AS
. O

my O
every O
need O
. O

i O
' O

been O
to O
this O

over O
a O

i O
ever O

our O

i O
have O
not B-OP
a I-OP
bad I-OP
thing O
to O

about O
this O

the O

great B-OP
! O

it O
' O
s O

very O
* O
reasonably B-OP
priced O
, O
esp O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
the O

i O
had O
the O
kafta B-AS
plate I-AS
and O
it O
was O
perfect B-OP
. O

– O
in O
a O
age O
of O
incremental O
cost O
cutting O
in O
restaurants O
, O
its O
nice O
to O
see O
a O
place O
that O
bucks O
that O
trend O
, O
and O
just O
plain O
delivers O
high B-OP
quality I-OP
food B-AS
and O
good B-OP
service B-AS
, O
period O
. O

this O
is O
the O
place B-AS
to O
relax B-OP
and O
enjoy B-OP
the O
finest B-OP
quality I-OP
food B-AS
the O
industry O
can O
offer O
. O

caution O
- O
its O
real B-OP
food B-AS
for O
people O
who O
love O
the O
best B-OP
. O

i O
liked B-OP
the O
atmosphere B-AS
very O
much O
but O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not B-OP
worth I-OP
the O
price O
. O

i O
may O
not O
be O
a O
sushi O
guru O
but O
i O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
the O
food B-AS
here O
is O
just O
okay B-OP
and O
that O
there O
is O
not O
much O
else O
to O
it O
. O

rice B-AS
is O
too O
dry B-OP
, O
tuna B-AS
was O
n B-OP
' I-OP
t I-OP
so I-OP
fresh I-OP
either O
. O

i O
have O
eaten O
here O
three O
times O
and O
have O
found O
the O
quality O
and O
variety O
of O
the O
fish B-AS
to O
be O
excellent B-OP
. O

however O
, O
the O
value B-AS
and O
service B-AS
are O
both O
severely O
lacking B-OP
. O

furthermore O
, O
while O
the O
fish B-AS
is O
unquestionably O
fresh B-OP
, O
rolls B-AS
tend O
to O
be O
inexplicably O
bland B-OP
. O

the O
service B-AS
ranges O
from O
mediocre B-OP
to O
offensive B-OP
. O

on O
a O
recent O
trip O
, O
our O
waiter B-AS
was O
extremely O
dismissive B-OP
, O
while O
no O
less O
than O
three O
staff B-AS
members I-AS
waited O
hand O
- O
and O
- O
foot O
on O
a O
pair O
of O

such O
detail O
to O
everything O
from O
miso B-AS
soup I-AS
to O
complex B-OP
rolls B-AS
. O

the O
sashimi B-AS
was O
the O
freshest B-OP
and O
most O
tender B-OP
i O
have O
ever O
tasted O
. O

their O
apps B-AS
are O
all O
delicious B-OP
. O

the O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
this O
place B-AS
is O
really O
expensive B-OP
and O
the O
portions B-AS
are O
on O
the O
small B-OP
side O
. O

but O
the O
space B-AS
is O
small B-OP
and O
lovely B-OP
, O
and O
the O
service B-AS
is O
helpful B-OP
. O

– O
the O
food B-AS
was O
not B-OP
great I-OP
& O
the O

though O

one O
thing O
i O
realized O
later O
on O
was O
that O
the O

either O
used O
msg O
or O
a O
meat O
tenderizer O
on O
the O
steak B-AS

the O
desert B-AS
was O
the O
perfect B-OP
ending O
to O
an O
almost O
perfect B-OP
dinner B-AS

overall O
, O
i O
would O
go O
back O

at O
best O
, O
the O

been O
lower O

the O
presentation O
of O

excellent B-OP
and O
it O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
you O
feel O
more O
sophisticated O
just O
for O
being O
there O
; O
but O
peel O
back O
the O
layers O

you O
have O
an O
overpriced B-OP

to O
start O
off O
, O
approximately O
8 O
- O
10 O
oz O
of O
orange B-AS
juice I-AS
will O
cost O
you O
$ O
3 O
. O

they O
serve O
it O
in O
a O
tall O
, O
skinny O
hour O

the O
fact O
that O
you O
a O
getting O
a O
small B-OP
juice B-AS
at O
the O
price O
of O
a O
half O
gallon O
in O
a O
supermarket O
. O

i O
should O
have O
just O
asked O
for O
the O
check O
when O
i O
saw O
that O
; O
but O
their O
menu B-AS
was O
so O
unique B-OP
that O
i O
continued O

the O

certainly O
inventive B-OP

of O
3 O
different O

is O
well O
over B-OP

priced I-OP
. O

the O
pancakes B-AS
should O
be O
larger O
( O
at O
least O
8 O

) O
to O
justify O
the O
expense O
even O
with O
the O
unique O

on O
my O
meal B-AS
i O
had O
to O
send O

simple O
request O
of O
breaking O
the O

would O
have O
had O

if O

rejected O
the O
meal O
all O

i O
rejected O
it O
because O
in O
the O
process O
of O
attempting O
to O
fix O
the O
eggs O
they O
broke O
something O
else O
in O
the O
dish B-AS

i O
was O
too O
frustrated B-OP

given O
its O
gorgeous B-OP

i O
had O
suspected O
that O
the O
accolades O
were O
more O
due O
to O
the O
scenery O
than O
to O
the O

. O

imagine O
my O
happy B-OP

upon O

recommend I-OP
going O
here O

you O
are O
likely O
to O
be O
disappointed B-OP

it O
was O
romantic B-OP
- O
and O
even O
nice O
even O
with O
my O
sister O
, O
reminded O
me O
of O
italy O
, O
and O
had O
artwork B-AS
and O
music B-AS
that O
kept O
up O
the O
feeling O
of O
being O
in O
a O
mediterrean O
villa O
. O

i O
recommend B-OP
it O
for O
a O
night O
when O
you O
want O
to O
splurge O
! O
( O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
expensive B-OP
) O

the O
best O
thing O
is O
, O
the O
prices O
are O
also O
quite O
reasonable B-OP
. O

hidden O
little O
jem B-OP

– O
tucked O
away O
over O

the O
beverly O

you O
routinely O
see O
indian O
families O
and O
friends O
dining O
there O
, O
which O
is O
always O
a O
good B-OP
sign O
. O

normally O
, O
places O
ask O
how O
hot O
you O
want O
it O
, O
but O
they O
did O
n O
' O
t O
. O

i O
should O
have O
thought O
to O
bring O
it O
up O
but O
never O
expected O
the O
food B-AS
to O
be O
that O
mild B-OP
. O

and O
they O
packaged O
everything O
nicely B-OP
so O
it O
did O
n O
' O

spill O
. O

awesome B-OP

you O
can O
order O
to O
go O
if O
you O
have O
to O
get O
back O

the O

too O

lebanese B-AS

! O
yum B-OP
! O

– O
i O
' O
ve O
been O
to O
open B-AS
sesame I-AS
only O
once O
, O
but O
i O
' O
m O
still O
reeling O
from O
the O
experience O
! O
! O

what O
a O
tastly B-OP
, O
flaky B-OP
treat O
! O

there O
have O
been O
several O
occasions O
when O
we O
' O
ve O
just O
not O
gotten O
some O
side O
dishes O
we O
' O
ve O
ordered O
. O

we O
waited O
over O
30 O
minutes O
for O
our O
drinks O
and O
over O
1 O
1 O
/ O
2 O
hours O
for O
our O
food O
. O

however O
, O
one O
sunday O
afternoon O
my O
husband O
and O
i O
did O
go O
( O
although O
with O
my O
loud O
protests O
) O
and O
were O
pleasantly B-OP
surprised O
. O

it O
was O
like O
dining O
at O
a O
completely O
different O
restaurant O
. O

we O
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great B-OP
experience O
, O
sampling O
more O
small O
plates O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
the O
beer B-AS
( B-OP
cold O
and B-OP
good O
) O
. O

we O
did O
have O
the O
same O
waiter B-AS
the O
second O
time O
, O
so O
maybe O
the O
service O
is O
spotty O
and O
our O
luck O
is O
good B-OP
. O

sunday O
afternoons O
there O
is O
a O
band B-AS
playing O
and O
it O
is O
lots O
of O
fun B-OP
. O

nice B-OP
job O
! O

this O
is O
sad B-OP
for O
what O
once O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
places O
you O
could O
ever O
eat O
. O

i O
hope O
one O
day O
scooner B-AS
or I-AS
later I-AS
returns O
to O
what O
it O
once O
was O
. O

untill O
this O
happens O
, O
my O
advice O
is O
to O
stay O
away O
. O

old O

we O
had O

the O

when O

we O
are O

it O

sad O
there O
is O
not O
many O
people O
who O
frequent O
eating O
at O
places O
like O
these O
that O
look O
pricey O
because O
they O
are O
at O
the O

but O
they O
are O
definitely O
one O
you O
dont O
want O
to O
miss O
, O
esp O
if O
your O
in O
downtown O
san O
jose O
. O

we O
easily O
spent O
more O
than O
$ O
40 O
per O
person O
( O
not O
including O
alcohol O
) O
and O
were O
still O
hungry O
. O

i O
' O
m O
astonished B-OP
that O
this O
restaurant B-AS
is O
categorized O
as O
$ O
$ O
$ O
rather O
than O
$ O
$ O
$ O
$ O
. O

we O
put O
out O
name O
down O
and O
although O
there O
were O
open O
tables O
we O
were O
told O
that O
it O
' O
d O
be O
a O
30 O
minute O
wait O
. O

we O
went O
back O
to O
the O
restaurant O
and O
low O
and O
behold O
, O
we O
were O
seated O
at O
one O
of O
the O
tables O
that O
was O
available O
30 O
minutes O
ago O
! O
! O

none O
that O
i O
can O
think O
of O
. O

we O
put O
in O
our O
order O
and O
although O
we O
ordered O
4 O
appetizers O
, O
the O
food O
did O
n O
' O
t O
arrive O
until O
45 O
minutes O
later O
. O
. O
. O
with O
our O
main O
course O
. O

um O
so O
now O
what O
are O
appetizers O
for O
? O
? O
? O

oh O
i O
forgot O
to O
mention O
that O
they O
do O
n O
' O
t O
have O
bread O
service O
. O

my O
wife O
also O
ordered O
a O
teapot O
of O
hot O
water O
( O
she O
had O
a O
sore O
throat O
) O
and O
i O
guess O
that O
since O
it O
was O
only O
water O
, O
it O
was O
n O
' O
t O
a O
priority O
for O
them O
to O
actually O
bring O
it O
. O

in O
other O
words O
, O
if O
they O
are O
n O
' O
t O
making O
$ O
$ O
off O
of O
you O
then O
you O
do O
n O
' O
t O
rate O
high O
on O
their O
' O
service B-AS
scale O
' O
. O

its O
great B-OP
if O
you O
spent O
the O
day O
there O
and O
did O
n O
' O
t O
want O
to O
drive O
to O
eat O
. O

parking O
is O
reasonably O
good B-OP
, O
they O
have O
their O
own O
lot O
and O
you O
can O
park O
in O
the O
park O
nearby O
. O

always O
good B-OP
. O

6pm O
on O
a O
sat O
before O
a O
broadway O

we O
were O
quickly O
seated O
and O
served O
. O

as O
part O
of O
a O
small O
party O
of O
four O
, O
our O
food O
was O
dropped O
off O
without O
comment O
; O

any O
further O
needs O
we O
may O
have O
had O
could O
not O
have O
been O
met O
since O
no O
one O
stopped O
by O
the O
table O
. O

when O
we O
finally O
were O
able O
to O
flag O
someone O
down O
, O
it O
was O
someone O
entirely O
different O
from O
the O
person O
who O
had O
dropped O
off O
the O
food O
, O
who O
was O
also O
not O
the O
same O
person O
who O
had O
taken O
our O
order O
. O

a O
brief O
conversation O
with O
the O
manager B-AS
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
was O
the O
greatest O
disappointment B-OP
- O
- O
to O
say O
we O
had O
been O
` O
` O
blown O
off O
' O
' O
would O
be O
an O
understatement O
. O

the O
manager B-AS
continually O
interrupted O
with O
` O
` O
is O
there O
anything O
else O
i O
can O
do O
for O
you O
? O
` O
` O
, O
a O
strange O
comment O
because O
she O
had O
hardly O
listened O
, O
let O
alone O
responded O
to O
our O
expression O
of O
disappointment B-OP
at O
our O
experience O
. O

she O
promised O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
waitress O
who O
had O
flown O
off O
in O
a O
rage O
, O
but O
we O
could O
hardly O
take O
her O
promise O
seriously O
, O
seeing O
as O
she O
had O
n O
' O
t O
bothered O
to O
get O
the O
waitresses O
name O
. O

in O
short O
, O
schooner O
or O
later O
could O
n O
' O
t O
have O
cared O
less O
about O
our O
being O
at O
their O
establishment O
. O

you O
are O
with O
a O
hot O
date O
and O
he O
/ O
she O
has O
an O
urge O
for O
sushi B-AS
. O
. O
. O
then O
this O
might O
be O
the O
place O
. O

and O
they O
give O
good B-OP
quantity O
for O
the O
price O
. O

we O
were O
only O
in O
seattle O
for O
one O
night O
and O
i O
' O
m O
so O
glad B-OP
we O
picked O
rays B-AS
for O
dinner O
! O

this O
is O
the O
case O
at O
this O
gem O
. O

you O
ca O
n O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
here O
. O

seriously O
, O
you O
ca O
n O
' O
t O
go O
wrong O
, O
if O
it O
is O
unpretentious O
local O
fun B-OP
you O
seek O
. O

my O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
i O
had O
that O
signature O
? O
msg O
? O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
i O
left O
the O
restaurant O
. O

they O
came O
in O
their O
own O
nifty O
take O
out O
box O
and O
with O
some O
homemade O
frosting O
; O
very O
light B-OP
and O
not B-OP
- I-OP
too I-OP
- I-OP
sweet I-OP
. O

the O
dinner O
only O
took O
us O
about O
an O
hour O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
alright B-OP
for O
the O
strip O
, O
almost O
$ O
50 O
/ O
pp O
after O
tax O
and O
tip O
( O
about O
average O
) O
. O

just O
remember O
to O
dress O
a O
little O
urban O
- O
chic O
so O
you O
don O
? O
t O
look O
too O
far O
out O
of O
place O
. O

very O
good B-OP
! O

overpriced B-OP

waited O
35 O
minutes O
for O
a O
table O
for O
8 O
which O
was O
ok B-OP
for O
such O
a O
big O
crowd O
. O

not O
sure O
if O
i O
would O
go O
back O
. O

in O
fact O
, O
many O
want O
to O
return O
a O
second O
time O
during O
their O
visit O
. O

they O
are O
n O
' O
t O
the O
most O
talkative O
, O
but O
everytime O
i O
' O
ve O
been O
there O
they O
have O
been O
very O
busy O
, O
which O
probably O
accounts O
for O
the O
lack O
of O
conversation O
. O

it O
' O
s O
just O
the O
right B-OP
size O
for O
the O
menu O
. O

excellent B-OP

you O
never O
feel O
icky O
and O
stuffed O
after O
you O
eat O
there O
. O

the O
pizza B-AS
' I-AS
s I-AS
are O
light B-OP
and O
scrumptious B-OP
. O

worth B-OP
the O
wait O

– O
had O
to O
wait O
thirty O
minutes O
to O
get O
in O
the O
door O
on O
a O
tuesday O
morning O
, O
but O
it O
was O
so O
worth B-OP
it O
. O

go O
with O
some O
friends O
, O
wait O
the O
half O
hour O
or O
so O
with O
a O
cup O
of O
joe O
, O
and O
enjoy B-OP
more O
than O
your O
average O
breakfast B-AS
. O

i O
do O
n O
' O
t O
know O
why O
anyone O
would O
want O
to O
write O
a O
great O
review O
about O
this O
place B-AS
. O

donot O
go O
! O

delicious B-OP

we O
waited O
for O
an O
hour O
to O
be O
seated O

on O

- O
70 O
minutes O
. O

will O
definitely O
be O

delicious B-OP

. O
! O

delectable B-OP

once O
you O
' O
re O
inside O
, O
the O
real O
experience O
begins O
. O

i O
probably O
would O
n O
' O
t O
go O
back O
though O
' O
cuz O
i O
do O
n O
' O
t O
know O
if O
it O
' O
s O
worth O
it O
. O

maybe O
i O
' O
ll O
go O
back O
once O
more O
many O
years O
from O
now O
when O
i O
' O
ve O
forgotten O
i O
went O
there O
already O
. O

sit O
in O
the O
balcony B-AS

– O
not B-OP
bad I-OP
. O

although O
the O
service B-AS
could O
be O
improved O
considering O
the O
money O
you O
put O
in O
. O

our O
drinks O
kept O
coming O
but O
our O
server B-AS
came O
by O
a O
couple O
times O
. O

should O
check O
- O
up O
on O
us O
more O
frequently O
, O
do O
n O
' O
t O
you O
think O
? O

the O
most O
pleasant B-OP
surprise O
was O
the O
check O
that O
did O
not O
exceed O
my O
expectations O
as O
it O
always O
happens O
in O
most O
of O
the O
places O
. O

i O
felt O
ackward B-OP
and O
next O
time O
went O
to O
the O
casino O
bathroom O
. O

this O
place B-AS
rocks B-OP
! O
! O

the O
chips B-AS
and O
salsa B-AS
are O
so O
yummy B-OP
, O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
fabulous B-OP
. O

the O
atmosphere B-AS
is O
aspiring B-OP
, O
and O
the O
decor B-AS
is O
festive B-OP
and O
amazing B-OP
. O
. O

insultingly O
overpriced B-OP

- O
mediocre B-OP
service B-AS
/ O
quality O

to B-OP
their I-OP
credit I-OP
they O
removed O
the O
dish O
from O
the O
check O
; O
but O
no O
manager B-AS
stopped O
by O
to O
ask O
what O
the O
problem O
was O
. O

two O
rascally O
kids O
were O
seated O
near O
us O
for O
the O
first O
part O
of O
our O
dinner O
. O
. O
. O
they O
were O
replaced O
by O
a O
delightful O
preteen O
who O
pretended O
to O
gag O
every O
time O
seafood O
was O
mentioned O
at O
her O
table O
. O

all O
considered O
, O
i O
have O
to O
say O
that O
ray B-AS
' I-AS
s I-AS
boathouse I-AS
is O
deserving O
of O
its O
title O
as O
a O
seattle O
institution O
