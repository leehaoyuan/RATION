The food is great too.	The food is terrible.	CONS: The food was pretty crummy.	The food is average at best.	The atmosphere is bleh but it's not bad.	The beer menu is extensive.	Love this place.	And, the food is decent.	The beer list is good and interesting.	The atmosphere is chill.	The owner is incredibly rude and argumentative.	The dressing is too sweet.	The crab fries are the best!	This place is awesome!	Cool bar.	The atmosphere is casual and comfortable.	Great beer selection!	A fun place to hang out with friends.	And the food is quite mediocre.
