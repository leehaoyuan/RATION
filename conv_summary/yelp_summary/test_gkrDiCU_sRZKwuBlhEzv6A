The sushi was drastically overpriced.	The service is top notch.	The staff was japanese too.	I love Shiroi Hana.	The sushi was delicious and very fresh.	The service is quick.	Incredible sushi!	The California roll was hastily made.	The fish is fresh and well cut.	The fish is fine, nothing special.	The presentation of the sushi is perfect.	The service was not bad.	The salad was pretty average.	I ordered the Chirashi, which was delicious.	This place was good.	Crunchy roll - this was by far the worst.	Deco is nice and clean.	Good shrimp shumai.	Excellent food.
