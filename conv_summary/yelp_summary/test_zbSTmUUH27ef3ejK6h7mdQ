The onion rings GREASY.	The burger was fine.	This place is great!	I love Charlie's.	It was a good quality burger.	The meat is OK.	The shakes are awesome.	Great food and service.	A Delco classic.	Great employees as well.	The best burgers around!!	The grill man is a master.	The staff is super friendly.	The menu is simple.	The burger itself was very flavorful.	The menu is very limited.	The buns are conventional, but very plush.	Love that this place is environmentally friendly.	Service was good.	Great old school burger spot.	This place is no joke.
