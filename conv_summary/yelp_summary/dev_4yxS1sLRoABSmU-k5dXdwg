The muscle appy was delicious!	The sushi is great.	The menu is awesome.	The crystal shrimp taste and texture was perfect.	This vegan sushi is LEGIT!	This place is terrible.	This place is a fucking joke.	The nigiri sushi was fantastic though.	The decor and atmosphere are great.	Try the Shannon roll!	They have excellent customer service.	The staff is very friendly.	The sushi itself was hit or miss.	The muscles were not that good either.	The servers and sushi chefs are super nice.	I LOVE Sushi Lover.	Great food!	This place is a gem!	This place is really fantastic.
