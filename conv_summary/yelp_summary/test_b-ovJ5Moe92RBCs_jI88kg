The california roll was alright.	The tonkotsu and uptown roll is a great deal!	The food was fantastic, the noodles delicious.	Love this place.	The food is horrible here.	The food was also inexpensive.	The ramen broth was bland.	The quality of our food was excellent!	The hot tea was great.	The server is awful and rude.	The waitress was extremely slow.	This place is a joke.	The food is always really good.	The rice was mushy.	Aw I like this place.	The place itself is perfect for night dining.	Crappy techno dance music.	Service is bad.
