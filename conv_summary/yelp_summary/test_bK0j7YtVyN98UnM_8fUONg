The outfits were loud as well.	Indifferent bartender.	The beer selection is average.	The music was loud!	The server was a complete idiot.	The establishment is a joke.	The table servers are great though, 2 stars.	It was a good drink.	This place is horrible.	Not great service.	The $5 burger was great.	And the Quizzo night sucked.	The drink specials are great and I love the food.	The manager Madison is really nice and helpful.	Great atmosphere and tasty food.	The bartenders during happy hour are the worst.	This place is vastly different from what I expected.
