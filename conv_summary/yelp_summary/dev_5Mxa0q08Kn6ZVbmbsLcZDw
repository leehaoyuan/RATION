The food was horrible.	The food we ordered was ok.	The cheese manicotti was served hot and amazing.	The staff was great.	The food was to die for as well!!	The service and price were disapointing.	The service was barely satisfactory.	The seating is awful.	Great food.	My favorite was the Prosciutto Stuffed Chicken.	The "Caesar" salad is abysmal.	The food was generally very good.	This place is amazing!	The food was delicious as usual.	The turkey was tender and the dressing perfect.	The portions are huge and the food is great!	We had plenty of food and space.
