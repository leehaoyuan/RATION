The coffee here is great.	The wireless sucked.	The atmosphere is a perfect coffee-shop vibe.	Great tea.	The soup was cold.	Beignets are awesome.	Love this place!	Alcohol is limited which I love for a coffeshop.	I thought the food was okay.	The food is decent, but not great.	A great spot to spend a snowy Sunday morning.	Awesome coffee shop, especially for studying.	This cafe is undoubtedly a great space, visually.	Well done Cafe Ventana!	I loved this place!	They have plenty of seating, both indoor and outdoor.
