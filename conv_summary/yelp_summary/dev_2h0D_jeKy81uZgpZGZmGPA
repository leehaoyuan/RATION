The rice was weirdly hard and grainy.	The customer service was awesome.	The food was beyond belief.	The sides were awesome though.	The Kalbi and pork are pretty good.	The loco moco was decent, but overpriced.	The eggs were perfectly cooked.	The service was good and friendly.	The macaroni salad was okay.	The BBQ is absolutely delicious.	The teriyaki chicken was the same, good flavor.	The chicken was pretty good too.	Legit Hawaiian.	The portions are beyond generous.	The food in return was ok.	The homemade teriyaki sauce was fantastic.	The BBQ and hot sauce are outstanding!
