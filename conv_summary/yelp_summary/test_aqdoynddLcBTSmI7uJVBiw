I love Miles Auto Spa.	And free Wi-Fi.	Clean car.	The owners refused to meet to discuss and look over the vehicle.	This place is terrible!	This place is ridiculous.	I liked the cleanup done on my interior panels and wheel.	The interior work was average at best.	Love that customer service!	Great place!	This place has gone downhill.	Very disappointing service.	I really want to like this place.	The interior was almost ignored it seemed.	Only full price service.	Extremely rude people.	I notice something is wrong with my truck.	Had a great experience with the staff.
