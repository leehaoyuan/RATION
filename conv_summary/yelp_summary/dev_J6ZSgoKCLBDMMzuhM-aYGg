The view was amazing.	The room was decent and clean.	The television didn't work at all.	Great customer service.	We loved the room.	The Silver Legacy is awesome!	The bathroom was dark and uninviting as well.	The service is fancy and well done.	Great show!	The room my boyfriend and I got had a nice view.	The room was also quiet with a comfortable mattress.	Love the location and atmosphere.	The pool was a complete disappointment.	They had a farmer's market, which was great.	cheapskates casino.	The gentleman working the front desk was nice.	Circus Circus was quite good too.
