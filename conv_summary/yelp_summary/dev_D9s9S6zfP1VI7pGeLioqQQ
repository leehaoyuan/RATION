The food was delicious.	Great atmosphere.	I enjoy going to Boscos.	The service was mediocre.	The Flaming Stone beer is always good of course.	The buffalo chicken pizza is excellent as well.	Good food.	My favorite Nashville brewpub.	The pizza is just okay.	The salad was great and the pizza hit the spot.	The beer is good, like you would expect.	The service was good and the food was pretty tasty.	The service was just fine as well.	And subsequently the beer dampens the taste buds.	The food has improved.	Their beer selection is decent.
