Love Kyoto!	The food is delicious.	The avocado roll was excellent.	The rice was terrible.	The sushi is pretty good.	It was the perfect amount of food.	The portions were OK, too.	The sushi menu was extensive and fresh.	The hibachi chef was amazing!	Cold food.	This is my go to place.	My favorite is the Bustleton roll	The portions are large, especially for the price.	It's my favorite sushi spot.	The restaurant was very nice looking and clean.	The service has always been mixed.	The half price sushi is out of this world.	I love this sushi place!
