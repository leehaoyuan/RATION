The food was fresh and delicious.	I love Pei Wei.	Great FOH staff.	The food needs to be better.	The lomein is also delicious!	The rice was hard.	The Teriyaki was delicious.	The rice is dry as well.	The sauce is great though.	The service is quite top notch as well.	The general cleanliness was frightening.	The food is mediocre at best.	Great location.	The spring rolls were ok.	The food was piping hot and fresh.	Love this place.	Our dish was spicy & beefy, hahaha!	The food was actually pretty good.
