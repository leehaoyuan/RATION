The beers were good.	The drink size is huge.	The Schweddy was my favorite in both name and taste.	The salad was unique.	The staff is friendly and prompt.	The decor was awesome.	The BBQ chicken pizza was very good.	The crust was nice and thin.	Good pizza and beer right on the Monon Trail.	Breadsticks are okay.	The atmosphere is cool and relaxed.	Nice selection.	Excellent service.	Service was great too!	The beer however, was not a joke.	We love their pizza.	The pizza was good, but I didn't really like the sauce.	They have great drinks and pizza!
