The waffles are delicious.	Cappuccino and Mocha is delicious.	They offer free wireless too.	Sweet sassy molassy.	The waffles are an addiction and I recommend the strawberry filled.	Needless to say, I love Bonte.	umm, the waffles are gross.	The waffle itself is kinda hard.	I love this place!	I got Pecans though, they were a tasty choice.	This place is well-hidden but totally worth it.	The plain sugar waffle is definitely my favorite.	But Bonte remains my favorite.	The staff was super chill and cool.	Great customer service as well!	The coffee was pretty good - and, free refills!
