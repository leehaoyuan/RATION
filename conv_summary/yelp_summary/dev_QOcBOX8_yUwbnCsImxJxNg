The chocolate frosted cruller was our favorite.	The donuts were delicious.	A large variety of Danishes and cookies.	The cake wasn't that great either.	This place is the best.	This donut is classier, baby.	My wife had a boston cream donut and loved it.	Croissants are awesome too.	Love this place.	The parking lot is a hellscape.	This is a 5 star bakery.	The cream donuts and sticky buns are fantastic.	The cream donuts lived up to the hype!	The baked goods are old-world incredible.	Great cupcakes and pastries.	The cake is heavenly!	This place was cute inside.
