The room was magnificient.	This hotel was superb, and we had a lovely stay.	We had the breakfast buffet included with our room and were very satisfied.	The service was outstanding and the location is second to none!	It was close to the Metro and the arch de Triomphe.	We were looking for a perfect experience in Paris and we found it.	The staff was very nice and accommodating.	Location would have to be the best in Paris, with everything at your fingertips.	The location was great.	The room we were given was extremely small and in deplorable condition.
