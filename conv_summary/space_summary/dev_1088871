Staff are very helpful and friendly.	9) The hotel is just a 5-minute walk to the Outram MRT station.	The hotel isn't awful, but I wouldn't stay there again.	Very modern and clean hotel.	A plus is the quiet location of the hotel.	Room was still quite small, but clean and comfortable.	The room is very trendy and clean.	Rooms are small, but nicely decorated.	Location: good location but does not have a lot of public transport nearby.	We loved this hotel: clean but small rooms.	Location is VERY good.
