This is a good value hotel with communications better than you might think.	Moving onto the bathroom, it was horrid!	The bed was comfortable and the bathroom OK.	The room was very clean and well serviced.	The reception area was unwelcoming and it needs a touch of paint.	The bathroom was a bit small but adequate.	The room was too hot, as there was no air-conditioning.	The hotel is very basic-but if you just require a bed for the night it is fine.	Everything else in the room was basic but adequate.
