The staff were very friendly and helpful.	The breakfast was excellent by Italian standards and is included in our room rate.	The Kette Hotel was in an excellent location.	Breakfast was good but I agree with other reviews that the breakfast room is too small.	The rooms are spacious, spotlessly clean and well appointed.	The bathroom was also modern and clean.	The room was a good size, comfortable and clean.	The hotel is located within easy walking distance to St. Mark's and the Grand Canal.	The staff was very helpful and the breakfast buffet was wonderful.
