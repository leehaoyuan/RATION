The room was very comfortable, clean and quiet.	The hotel was near to china town- just 5 minutes walk.	Staff were friendly and helpful.	The Miramar is a nice hotel.	The hotel was a decent place to stay in.	Good value for money and a good breakfast, would go back again.	The pool was very nice and made use of the jaciuzzi.	The shuttle bus for Singapore Stopovers stops right outside the hotel which was great.	We would recommend this hotel while staying in Singapore.	The hotel was very clean and the rooms are fairly spacious.
