The bathroom was filthy and the shower curtain had a layer of grease on it.	The room I stayed in (112) was a single and very small, see the photos.	The location was the best thing about eh!!	The room was very basic but clean and functional.	The room was very small, but comfortable for me.	The rooms were not clean.	The window wouldn't open and it was stifling in the room - you couldn't turn the radiator off.	We stayed there for 3 nights and we had our room cleaned and got clean towels every morning.
