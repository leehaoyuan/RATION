The Grand Cypress was a wonderful place to stay.	The staff we met were both friendly and very helpful.	The rooms are well appointed and very clean.	It is a beautiful and peaceful place.	We had a great time here.	Transportation was an ordeal during our entire stay.	The housekeeping staff were incredibly nice and professional and respectful.	The staff is friendly and professional.	We had a large one bedroom villa on the water.	Away from the noise and very private.	This place is the perfect antidote to the madness of Disney.	The service was outstanding.
