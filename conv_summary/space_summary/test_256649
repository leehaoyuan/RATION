We stayed in a two bedroom apartment overlooking the city and darling harbour.	The room was more than spacious with fantastic facilities.	The concierge were extremely friendly and helpful in all occasions we needed to use a taxi.	Beds were very comfortable and rooms ambient.	The room was large but not very clean (compared to the price of the hotel room).	We stayed here for 3 nights and had a great time.	It is a great location and very convenient to town.	The variety of pillows and a soft bed was a bonus.
