The room was clean and well maintained throughout our stay.	Importantly the room was clean and quiet.	The rooms are spacious and comfortable.	Great value for the price; I would definitely stay here again.	The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the Causeway Bay MTR station, and there are plenty of restaurants nearby.	The free drinks and snacks is also a nice touch.	We loved this hotel and would stay again!	Great service and the food was sublime.	The staff was more than helpfull in lending us DVDs so we could kill time.
