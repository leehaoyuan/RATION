The staff were very friendly and helpful.	The location is great, close to a Metro stop.	The staff on the front desk speak excellent English and were very helpful.	The room was a good size and very clean.	The rooms are a bit austere, but very clean.	Breakfast was simple, but we were just happy to have it included.	The hotel is close to the historical district and within walking distance to the colosseum and other attractions.	The hotel was excellent and the location was great.	The bathroom was small, but perfectly functional.	The location and price were great.
