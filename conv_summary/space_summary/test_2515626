The staff was very helpful and friendly.	The room was spacious and I loved the bathroom.	The roms were very clean and comfortable.	We were very pleased with our stay here.	The room was very nice and clean and we had a view of the ocean.	The location is great, too.	The hotel is beautiful, I would compare it to an Aloft.	We couldn't ask for a more perfect place to stay.	The rooms are very clean and simple with very comfortable beds.	The blend of luxury and location is ideal.	The food was OUTSTANDING.
