The staff is very friendly and helpful.	The room was clean and spacious.	The room we had was large and very comfortable and the people behind the front desk were helpful.	The room was clean, but not comfortable.	We thought the rooms were very clean (important) and beds were comfortable.	It was the noisiest room I've stayed at in a long time.	The staff was very friendly and the room quite comfortable.	The location is convenient for shopping and dining.	It is a small hotel, but rooms are wonderful and it is well maintained.
