The rooms were very clean and comfortable.	Staff was very friendly and helpful.	The shuttle from the airport to the hotel was very convenient.	This was a nice hotel-updated and clean.	The hotel was nice and the location was great.	The room that we stayed in was recently renovated.	The hotel staff was excellent and accommodating.	The room was very big and clean.	The room was wonderful!	It is a 10 minute walk from the hotel and well worth it.	This is probably the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in .
