The hotel was clean and quiet during our stay.	The staff was friendly and helpful.	We stayed in a non-smoking room that needed to be fumigated.	The rooms are in disrepair.	Staff was extremely courteous and helpful.	The locality is very run down, and at night can be intimidating.	The staff was worthless.	The staff was very nice and the room was clean.	Lights did not work when we checked in.	The room was a little small, but adequate.	The location of the hotel was pretty good.	It's the smallest room I have ever seen.
