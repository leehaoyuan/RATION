The room was clean and the bed comfortable.	Breakfast is basic and included in the price.	The room was small but had everything I needed, including a safebox.	This hotel is centrally located and great value for money.	Breakfast was fine, simple but it was plenty for us, I enjoyed it.	The bathroom is very clean and the location is great, but in average you can state that you're paying too much for wht you get.	It was basic and not too roomy, but for the location it met our needs.
