The breakfast was excellent for a 2 star hotel.	The staff were friendly and helpful.	The breakfast which was included was good.	No sleep for two nights - breakfast awful - couldn't wait to leave.	The hotel had a good location near the Rambla, and the metro station is just outside the door.	The hotel was spotlessly clean.	The breakfast was okay, but quite limited.	Location was also perfect, everything in walking distance, Metro stop just next to the hotel.	The breakfast was disgusting and also very noisy.	The location is great.	The room itself was immacaulate but basic.
