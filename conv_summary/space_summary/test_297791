The staff were very friendly and helpful.	The room was clean and nice.	It was close to everything.	We loved the coffee and buns provided free of charge every morning.	Not a bad place.	The experience that I had was beyond comprehension.	The service is great.	The room that we got was very comfortable.	The shower water is nice and hot.	A great place for the money.	The neighborhood is very safe and quiet.	The closet had no hangars.	This place is horrible.	Kitchenette was great.	This hotel is terrible!	It was a confortable room and I enjoyed it.
