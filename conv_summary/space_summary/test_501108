The rooms are comfortable and the bathroom is very nice.	Breakfast was not included in the room.	It was great that the mini bar was included in the price.	The mini bar that is free, added value to the hotel.	The hotel is clean and reasonably priced.	The reception staff were friendly and professional.	Meeting rooms are large and with a lot of sunlight.	Good service.	The room was good with a nice sea view.	We stayed there recently and loved the hotel.	Food was alittle pricey, but I guess you expect that in a city hotel.
