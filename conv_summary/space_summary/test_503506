The room was clean and the bed very comfortable.	The staff was very helpful and friendly.	The basic room is with a shared bathroom in the hall, which looks like an old school shower.	It was the strangest feeling I ever had in a hotel.	The staff were extremely helpful and courteous.	We had a great time at the Lloyd Hotel.	The rooms are inventive (showers in the middle of the room, moving walls, etc.).	Breakfast was comprehensive and not too expensive.	The staff were all very pleasant and helpful throughout our stay.	Breakfast was good, though not included.
