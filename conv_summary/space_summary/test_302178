The hotel is value for money.	The hotel is comfortable and clean but the room is small.	We had a room on the 12th floor overlooking the river.	Staff is very polite, and helpful.	Staff is very friendly and efficient.	The room was immaculate and unexpectedly large.	The only redeeming feature is the free shuttle bus which we took on a daily basis to get to Sha Tin MTR station.	The room was large and clean.	The service is also excellent.	Great experience, breakfast buffet is a great deal for the money.
