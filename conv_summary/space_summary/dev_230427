We had a wonderful stay at the Gritti hotel.	The staff were very helpful and pleasant.	The room was very nice and we had a view of the canal!	The hotel was wonderful.	The food is expensive but it's worth the experience.	This is a beautiful hotel.	The service was truly outstanding.	The front desk is very helpful.	The location is the best in Venice, and the staff is excellent.	The rooms are very nice.	The concierge were great and very helpful.	The location is very good, in the heart of Venice.
