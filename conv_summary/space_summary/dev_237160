The staff were friendly and incredibly helpful.	This was a perfect hotel for our stay and great value!	The hotel was clean and quiet.	It was reasonably priced and close to the train station.	The breakfast that was included in the room rate was definitively adequate, but no more.	The rooms were small but comfortable and very clean.	The hotel is decent and the rooms are clean.	The room and the bathroom were clean.	This is a great hotel.	The room was spotless and the location was just perfect.	We loved the location of this hotel.
