Staff were very friendly and helpful.	The rooms were clean and the hotel was in a good location.	This hotel is perfect for its value and location!	This hotel was good value for a money.	The bathroom is spacious and clean.	The bathroom is small but we got used to it.	A good place to stay if your on a budget.	We had a room on the 12th floor with a shared bathroom.	Shared bathroom was nice and also clean every time.	The staff was very helpful, but then we're pretty low-maintenance and don't need much.
