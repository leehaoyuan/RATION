The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly.	The rooms are comfortable, clean and spacious and I would stay here again if in Istanbul.	The location is perfect with views of the Blue Mosque and the water.	The rooms are thoughtfully laid out and very comfortable.	We loved our stay in the Emine Sultan Hotel.	The staff are unassuming and incredibly warm.	The rooms are amazing, everything is within walking distance and the service is outstanding.	The bathroom was private and well maintained.	The front desk staff is very friendly and helpfull.	This is a great boutique hotel.
