The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.	The rooms were small, but clean and very comfortable beds.	The hotel's location was fantastic, we walked to just about everywhere.	The location was perfect and close to everything.	The room was on the small side with a nice bathroom and was always clean.	The location is superb and the hotel is ideal.	Good location in Rome .	The staff was extremely helpful and very accomodating.	We stayed in a double room outside the hotel, but was only 5 metres away.
