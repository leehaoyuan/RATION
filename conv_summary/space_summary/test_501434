The staff I dealt with were very friendly and helpful.	The airconditioner worked well and was quiet.	The hotel room was very comfortable and clean, although a bit small.	The hallways and rooms are very modern, comfortable and clean!	It is located within walking distance of china town and the Irish market.	The room and bathroom were very clean and functional, lovely shower!	The room was tiny and spotlessly clean.	Good location in the City and close to the airport.	The "Delux" room was tiny, the bathroom was just clean enough.
