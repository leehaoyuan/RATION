The location off the 405 was so convenient for us.	The room was extremely spacious and spotlessly clean.	The aircondition was great!	The property is well spaced out with a nice looking outdoor pool and gardens.	The Luxe has outstanding service!!	The food was very good as well.	The staff was nice and helpful.	It was a very pleasant experience and we will stay there the next time we are in LA.	The heated swimming pool and surrounding garden is a real plus.	We were disappointed with the room and the service.	The rooms are large and comfortable.
