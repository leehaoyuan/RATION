The hotel is located in a beautiful and convenient area.	The staff was friendly and helpful.	The front desk service was poorer than that in the restaurant.	The room was spacious and relaxing, although the bathroom was quite small.	The service was fantastic.	The location was great.	It's location is the best in the city.	The room was clean and tidy.
