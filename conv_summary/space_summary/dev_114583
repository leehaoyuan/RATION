The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful.	The location is great, especially for the price.	The room was adequate, and the beds were pretty comfortable.	The continental breakfast was pitiful - and that is being nice.	The hotel is in walking distance to the Loop and subway stops.	The bed was very comfortable and the room very clean.	The coffee provided in the room is pretty disgusting.	Staff were helpful in the CTA information and you are very near locations to pick them up.	The room was available upon arrival and it was very clean.
