No recreational facilities.	The location is great but everything is awfull!	This hotel is ok!.	The room wasn't spacious but I'm not complaining with the price I paid.	We wanted a good hotel for our stay in Singapore, what a WASTE of money.	No room-safe, a shabby doorlock and so on.	The rooms are very basic but clean.	Rooms aren't clean.	Rooms was bad.	Breakfast was very poor.
