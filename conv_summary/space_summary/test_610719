The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.	The service is dismal.	The room was clean and reasonably priced.	The bathroom was faultless and appeared to be newly modernised.	The Impero Hotel in our opinion was excellent value for money and extremely quiet.	This hotel was very easy to find and in a good location.	The bathroom was clean and not too small, just nice.	Rooms were very clean.	The breakfast buffet was nice.	Breakfast was served in a clean, roomy and well lighted space.	Our room was quiet and clean.	The breakfast was average, but fine.	The hotel was lovely.
