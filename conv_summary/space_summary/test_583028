The hotel room was very comfortable, spacious and clean.	Great value for money and I would stay there again.	Staff were helpful and friendly.	The check-in staff were courteous and efficient.	The breakfast at the hotel is good.	The location of the hotel was great, being near Raffles and the Chimes restaurants.	The Hotel Royal is pretty good value for a hotel in this part of Singapore.	The breakfast was dissapointing - tasteless and with very limited choice, the same things for 7 days.	The check-in and check-out was very easy.
