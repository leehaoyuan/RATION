The staff was very friendly and helpful.	We stayed at Locanda Vivaldi for 3 days and had a wonderful time.	The staff were very helpful, the room was clean and quiet and we overlooked a canal.	Breakfast was very nice and the service there was great as well.	We stayed here for my husban's birthday during the carnival and had a great time.	The hotel is lovely, clean and well appointed.	The staff was very helpful and very professional.	We loved the breakfast nook.	We didn't find the location too noisy, despite being so central.
