The staff were very accommodating and helpful.	The staff were all very nice, friendly and helpful.	The bathroom was very tiny, but it was private which is a plus in any hostel.	The reception staff were SO friendly and helpful, even when overrun with people crowding the lobby whilst checking in.	The room and bathroom were both perfectly clean and comfortable.	This hotel/hostel was great for the price.	The staff at the reception were polite and helpful.	The room and bathrooms are cleaned every day.	The beds were comfy if a little creaky!
