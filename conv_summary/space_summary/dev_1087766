The gym and private hammam option is a real plus, as well.	The food and service is top notch.	The views of the Bosphorous are outstanding.	The location of this hotel on the banks of the Bosphorus is gorgeous and glamorous.	The rooms are spacious and well laid out.	The pool area and spa are quite beautiful.	The Bosphorous views and R&R by the pool after a day of sightseeing is the perfect end to (an always) busy Ä°stanbul day.	The pool is idyllic and the fitness centre and spa are both first class.
