Staff are very friendly and helpful.	The rooms were clean, comfortable and spacious.	We booked a room on Valentines day and the experience was fantastic.	The staff is friendly and the location is convient.	It was a great place to stay!	We found it a very comfortable and convenient location for our vacation.	The third night we had a better room, still stinking!	It was an excellent hotel, and we would certainly stay here again on our next trip to SF.	The room was huge, very comfortable and clean.	The room was also very small and not clean.
