A lovely hotel if you aren't paying for it.	Very nice rooms, quiet during the night.	This is a great hideaway in busy Venice.	This is a small, but perfectly located exceptional hotel.	The hotel was also located in a great location.	The hotel itself is lovely, nicely decorated and well maintained.	The room was spotlessly clean and very tasteful.	The breakfast room was small but luxurious with a good choice of food.	The hotel is in a quiet section of Venice which is a plus.
