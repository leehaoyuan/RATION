Staff were very friendly and helpful.	The hotel is very convenient to the train station.	The Triple Room was the best that we encountered in our 11 trips to Amsterdam.	The bed is clean and comfortable (in which I ended up spending a lot of time reading a novel).	The hotel is very nice, and clean.	The room was better than expected and on the 2nd floor.	The room was spacious and clean with a decent sized bathroom.	Breakfast was good, but quite expensive.	Breakfast was nice and very dutch, (well it is Amsterdam).	The place was clean and comfortable.
