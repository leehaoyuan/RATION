Rooms are nice and clean, breakfast is also good.	The rooms were clean and spacious.	We stayed at Hotel Praga for 3 nights and it must be the noisiest hotel we have stayed in!	There are quite a few restaurants and cafes within walking distance from the hotel.	The location of the hotel is not convenient for tourists.	Rooms are a bit small but clean and adequate.	Hotel Staff were very friendly and helpful.	The hotel is clean.	This hotel is very good for the price.	The hotel itself is very clean and the rooms realy quite good.
