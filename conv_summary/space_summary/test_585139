A great stay and a nice hotel!	The rooms are modern and spacious enough, even though I'd say they are slightly small.	It is a great location.	The location is great with 3 of the Gaudi sites within a short walking distance.	Staff were all extremely helpful and the room was spacious, comfortable and had a small balcony.
