The staff were very friendly and helpful.	The Belltown is very close to transportation.	This hotel was a great deal for the price.	It was quiet at night so we were able to sleep.	It overlooked the courtyard and had double-glazing.	The location couldn't have been better--seemed like we were walking distance to everything.	The hotel is close to everything, including great places to eat.	The staff here is excellent.	Location was maybe not in the safest neighborhood, but we encountered no problems.	The room was small, but I could've care less for the price I was paying.
