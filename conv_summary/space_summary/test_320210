The County hotel is in a pretty good location.	The bed was clean and comfortable, as was the room.	The English breakfast is okay, but very limited for vegetarians (eggs and baked beans).	This is probably the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.	The breakfast was excellent as well!	Breakfast was OK and set you up for a day of sightseeing.	The staff at reception were rude and looked like they'd rather be anywhere else but there.	The floors in the bathroom are rotting linoleum.
