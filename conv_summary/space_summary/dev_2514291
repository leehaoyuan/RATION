The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was spotless.	Staff were fine, smiley and friendly.	The room was clean and tidy though.	The worst hotel I've ever stayed in.	We enjoyed our sta here, and for Â£77 for the night we certainly couldn't grumble.	The staff were rude, unsympathetic and completely clueless.	The first night was perfect and we loved the location of the hotel.	The location is excellent but the staff need cheering up.	It was a pretty expensive place, but worth it if you have the money.	This Hotel is a horrible place to stay.
