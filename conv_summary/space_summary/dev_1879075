Staff is very friendly and helpful.	The room was nice and clean.	No airco (but we knew it).	Room quiet as they gave us one away from the street.	The hotel is sustainable and has all kinds of organic snacks, which is a nice plus.	The hotel room is not to small with a good sized bathroom.	The speech bubbles on the walls are a very nice touch - friendly and relaxing.	It was clean and large with a comfortable bed.	The service from the front door to check out was excellent and everyone very helpful.
