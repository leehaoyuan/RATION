Staff was nice and helpful.	The place was run down.	The rooms are quite presentable and hard to beat for the price.	The only positive I have to say is that the room was clean.	We had a suite overlooking the pool.	The room was small, but was fine for the one night I stayed.	Breakfast was nice and there was variety.	The rooms are clean and the housekeeping staff were very accomodating and helpful.	The continental breakfast was nice.	My husband and I are used to 4+ star hotels.	The location was perfect for that.
