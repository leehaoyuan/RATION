It may be in a really nice neighborhood, but it is DIRTY!!!!!	The room I had was clean and comfortable.	The rooms were clean, the staff was very helpful and friendly.	This is one of the dirtiest hotels I have seen in my life!	The room actually grows on you and is very nice after a long day of walking/sightseeing.	It was sparsely furnished but clean and the bed was comfortable.	My roommates said it was noisy at night, but I never heard anything.	The location is great.	Shared bathroom, there's not to much to say about this.
