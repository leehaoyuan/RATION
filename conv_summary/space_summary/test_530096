This hotel is amazing and the staff couldn't be any more helpful.	The staff at the hotel were very friendly, and helpful.	We would probably not recommend the hotel to friends and family purely because of the location but otherwise it is a good hotel.	The rooms were quite spacious, nice and clean.	The hotel was clean and I thought luxourious for the price we paid.	The area was extremely quiet and a bit of a ghost town.	The hotel was very well furnished and maintained.	This is a nice hotel.
