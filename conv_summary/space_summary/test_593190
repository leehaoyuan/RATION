The staff were extremely helpful and friendly.	The rooms are clean and comfortable.	The location isn't great but it's worth staying just to check out the hotel.	The room itself was clean and of a high standard - the bed was extemely comfortable.	The rooms are spacious, well appointed and immaculate.	The food and service was amazing.	The bar in the tip floor was kicking on a Friday night when we went and the spa is amazing as well.	The staff is young and very friendly.
